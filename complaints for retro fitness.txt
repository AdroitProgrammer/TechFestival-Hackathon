<p>Unbelievable! I am very, very angry! Yes, I got poor when I was with this gym. No, they are not easy to work with. My option was either to stay with the gym or you are forced to make one or two payments as a final result. Yes, I had car problems which cost high amount of money and my account was depleted. So when the company tried to take the money out of my bank account, there was no money. Not intentional, but things happen. So what happens? A company hired by Retro Fitness for bullying and trying to delegate how you are going to pay and what due date or else! They didn't even try to work with you. I ended up with that horrible, bullying boss call by hanging up. They tried to call back and I did not answer, period! </p>
<p>I had been a member of Retro Fitness for a little over a year. I was happy with the facility. However, I moved out of state in early Sept. of 2012. I had spoken with the owner beforehand and he told me that I would have to send some info for proof of residence and they would cancel my membership. Okay, fine. I could get much info quickly enough. I called the facility and asked what proof would be sufficient enough. I did not have my license yet; I did have my water/sewer bill. That was okay. I faxed it and my machine said "transmitted" which means it was received. </p>
<p>I have been a member for years and have recently found the conditions at this Howell Retro to be deplorable. This Saturday morning, there was toilet paper on the floor in the women's bathroom and it hadn't been cleaned. I also take offense to their sending me emails to advertise their other business venture, 21 South Bar and Grille. Not a particularly good connection to the health and fitness model they project.</p>
<p>Still been trying to contact the corporate office. Surprise! No answer! They take advantage of kids, especially. We have been trying to cancel membership since last August 2012. Still no luck!</p>
<p>I signed a contract for both a year of membership (Retro Fitness) and 6 months of PT. When I started to look at my bank statements, I saw they were not taking out the $19.99 they said was due but $40 each time. When I call and ask if someone is there that can help me, they set up a meeting and then the "manager" never shows up. I put a stop payment on my bank for them. But even before that, they sent me letters from their collection agency telling me I owe or they didn't have the right bank info, even though they were taking out double from my account the entire time. I paid my dues and just want to pay what I owe the next 6 months ($20 a month). I shouldn't have to fight. They take out double or keep charging me for the PT. I saw others’ reviews and thought, “Well, that's out of state. Maybe mine wouldn't be like that since they make you feel taken cared of.” Bull! **. They are just out to ruin your credit and take your money and as long as I can pay them what I signed for, I'm fine. But until then, I will continue to tell my bank to not pay them at all no matter how much it hurts my credit.</p>
<p>Trying to cancel membership - I sent a registered letter, cancelling my policy mid-April 2012. I received a charge on my credit card end of April. I figured okay, just the residue. I got another charge end of May. I disputed bills for April and May. I received a letter from a collection agency stating I owe. I replied with the registered letter receipt number. They ignored the letter and sent another. I told my credit card company to not allow any more bills and they agreed. I just received a phone call from ABC Financial Services, saying it was urgent I respond. I did not. I did send another letter to the collection agency. We'll see how far this goes.</p>
<p>I went to sign up and check out with a friend. Since I'm only in Manahawkin during the summer (couple of months), I only wanted a short term program. They told me sure a student program, but I was not sure of it. So I declined and told them so. But since they ran my credit card, they would send me a check, which they did (check # ** for $160.47, noted-3 day cancellation refund). But then, they kept charging my credit card monthly. I had my lawyer send a letter of my cancellation and refund (3 day refund). Then they charged me back the refund amount. </p>
<p>Billing Dispute - I signed up for a one-year membership at Retro Fitness in Dix Hills/Huntington NY area, that was to continue each month after that year was up and would cost me $20, being charged to my credit card. First off I hardly used the membership because of a back injury. I had a 3 level lumbar fusion surgery done in November of 2010. I was cut open from an inch over my belly button, all the way down to the crotch line. My insides were taken out. They then took out 3 discs replacing them with spacers, 3 cages,with 9 screws to hold it all in place. They then put me back together, flipped me over and sliced me 3 times in my back, while inserting a Titanium rod and 2 more screws to hold that in place.</p>
<p>My daughter went to work out and take her free training session that came with her membership. Apparently, they sold her a year's training in the amount of $2000.00. At that time she was told that she could cancel anytime, but apparently this is not so. She feels embarrassed that she was taken advantage of. She is a college student with no income. We have tried to explain this to several people, but no one wants to hear anything.</p>
<p>My identity got stolen and I tried to have a civilized conversation with Charlie, the female owner of Retro Fitness, and she immediately began yelling that she doesn't care about my problem and I can simply pay what I owe to get out of the contract. I explained to her that that money was tied up due to fraud, but again, all she did was yell and constantly remind how she doesn't care about my problems and that I am "locked" in a contract and must pay or else she will send the collections after me. I asked twice for the corporate office and she hung up the phone. She hung up. Instead of talking, she resorted to childish behavior.</p>
<p>My 15 year old son went in to get information about the gym.  They let him fill out a gym membership and started to take money from his account.  Now this is on his credit report.  I would like his money to be returned to him and that you remove this off his credit report.</p>
<p>People like the owner/manager Michael Padula are tools. Let me define tool. A tool is an apparatus or a (person) to get something done. To some, the word tool may have a much stronger derogatory meaning, but to me, it's an oversimplified sort of person. My contract with Retro Fitness was terminated because Padula got complaints from his staff and clients. I was not notified that I had such a caustic effect on some of the folks in the space. Padula is a tool, and tools like Padula think very 2 dimensionally. There is no reason why a gym should be run by a tool. I am the gregarious/friendly sort. One very unique trait is I am bluntly honest. Most people cannot handle my level of complete transparency. Padula, members of his staff, and some clients are just too narrow-minded and ignorant to enjoy their surroundings, and the people around them. Live, love, enjoy!</p>
<p>I called the billing company to cancel contract at contract's end in 1 week. I was told I had to go to the health club to fill out "paperwork" to cancel. The health club manager insisted I needed to send a certified letter requesting termination. The contract specifically states written notice need to be provided 60 days prior to "auto renewal" I was told.  This is in direct violation of New Jersey code 56:8-42 in regulating health club contracts that states "A health club services contract shall not obligate the buyer to renew the contract." </p>
<p>I was offered and signed on for a comprehensive personal training program that included my past, present and future fitness goals, strength and endurance training and a diet program for weight loss. Upon my second visit I was informed that I would not be given a diet plan as they were not dietitians. I had informed the trainer that I had a low back and shoulder injury; however he continuously instructed me to perform exercises and/or lift weights too heavy for my fitness level. I received no endurance program, and when asked was told that I looked like I knew what I was doing. </p>
<p>On November 28, 2007, my 17 year old daughter entered a one year agreement with this gym. She had her monthly amount of 21.39 deducted from her checking account. On September 4, 2008, we sent a letter requesting that her membership be discontinued due to her attendance at college. We sent the letter certified mail, return receipt requested, as required on the contract. However, the letter came back to us stating there is no such address. We double-checked the address on the contract and it was clearly sent to the right address. </p>

<p>Worst fitness ever, bad management, horrible people, and very racist. They will keep charging you even after you tell them you want to cancel. I told them I want to cancel my account because they treated me very bad and most of the machines are not working most of the time, and when I told them they said, "Ok but you have to pay 70% of what is remaining." I was like, "How does that make sense to pay 70% of the remaining monthly payments when I’m not gonna come anymore," they said it’s in the contract! Even that no one said anything when I was signing the contract, then I said, "Ok I’ll keep it and try to make a lemonade out of the lemon," but then few months later it gets worse so I was like, "No that’s enough. I don’t want to go to this place anymore."</p>
<p>There were two Retro Fitness locations that were convenient when I signed up at Retro 2 years ago, one near my home and one near work. Both locations are now closed. The one near my house closed on 24 December 2018. Now Retro will not let me cancel my automatic deduction from my credit card. I am told that I have to go to where I signed up... Duh the location that I signed up at IS NOW CLOSED. Just a bunch of crooks.</p>
<p>Retro Fitness in Oceanside, NY is a scam! If I could give ZERO stars- I would!! First off- SCAM. My credit card numbers were in someone else’s account and after $336.89 in charges on someone’s else’s account, Retro Fitness and their third party account memberships management, ABC Financial DECLINED to issue me a refund and fix this error. I know that it was an error with their membership account services / set up and they refuse to resolve this and basically told me to, "**, we are keeping your $336.89." If that’s not horrible customer service, what is? </p>
<p>I requested to cancel my membership which I was told to give it in written and said will be charged for next 3 months because we cancelled the contract. We agreed to pay 3 months and cancelled. Now it's been 5th month getting charged and talked to manager and he said the guy with whom we cancelled didn't gave you correct information and said we will be charged until 1 year.</p>
<p>I cancelled my membership on a third day I signed a contract (May 29h 2018). Just came to the gym on Y Avenue (325 Ave Y Brooklyn NY 11223 ) and told manager (don't recall his exact name **- gingerish guy with a beard) that I am done with them. I asked do I have to sign anything, he responded, "No, it's ok." I just need to give my name and my retro card, so I did. After a month I noticed that card was charged about $63. I called to the gym/to ABC. They responded it was just some maintenance fee that I had to pay anyway. WTF?! Moreover, I figured out that my membership was not canceled but frozen. I WAS NEVER TOLD ABOUT IT!!! </p>
<p>My 17 year old daughter joined Retro Fitness in Lincroft NJ when she began working/driving. They happily took her sign up fee and credit card information to bill her on a regular basis. Almost a year later, she was getting ready to leave for college. We needed to cancel her membership. I called the gym, asked for the manager so I could discuss my daughter's membership cancellation. The guy that answered the phone said that, Kathleen, wasn't available and that I needed to put my request in the form of a letter and send it in. Following instructions, I typed a letter on my daughter's behalf and walked it into the gym the next day. I asked for the manager and was told that she wasn't there. This was the second time the manager wasn't around. </p>
<p>Well, I guess it has been said enough already by other reviewers. I just agree with everything. It is a money making scheme run by greedy corporation. Yes, you will join in a second for $19.99 a month. But then they will start billing you all kinds of fees including their beloved $42 annual fee (for what???). I went to the gym directly, made them give me a copy of cancellation request and double checked again in a few days. Make sure you talk to a manager and not just to a cute young lady at the service desk. Still they charged me annual fee, but I am happy I got out from that terrible establishment. I also put my credit card on freeze so those crooks would not keep charging me.</p>
<p>I had been a member here since they opened their doors, I can't tell you how many times the toilets, elevators and exercise equipment has been broken or in need of cleaning. On top of that, although I went into the club three times to cancel my daughter's membership before she went to college, nobody at the front desk could manage to do it properly, which led to me continuing to be charged monthly and annual fees! When I went in again to speak to the staff, it was as if they'd never seen me before! Nobody had any recollection of me trying desperately to close her account, so I was basically told to go fly a kite. The manager actually offered to cancel my membership! What a way to treat clients.</p>
<p>I got sick and moved 2000 miles away from the club and they are forcing me to pay 6 months trainer sessions to the tune of $165 a month even with proof from the doctor and my mailing address. Stay away. Not worth the hassle.</p>
<p>After notifying Retro Fitness of my medical reasons for having to take time off from my program (hip replacement). I was told my account was FROZEN, my credit card was billed $280.00. I cancelled the card immediately. I approached Ms ** and was told it was a billing error. The following month they attempted to bill my card another $280.00 on the frozen account. After numerous calls with no return calls I was told by their representative that I was reimbursed for the $ 280.00 and Quote "she was tired of this ** and she would have Ms. ** call me." No Call. I have now filed a claim in court to get my money back. They also have a collection agency trying to get $199.00 from me on monthly dues on the FROZEN ACCOUNT. A firm warning stay away from this sleazy underhanded, LYING outfit.</p>
<p>They make it impossible to cancel your account - so many hoops to jump through. This should be a simple process. If you do to want a product or service, you can get out. Terrible customer experience. DO NOT JOIN THIS CLUB, you will have a difficult time getting out. Between my wife and my accounts, I feel like Retro Fitness (New City) stole over 2 years of money from my family. $19.99 x 2 = $39.98 a month at 2 years is $959.52 for nothing. Someone needs to do something about this gym. They take advantage of customers.</p>
<p>Bad customer service - the membership contract is set up to make sure you have a most difficulty to cancel and if you make any mistake sending your Certified Mail cancellation, your credit is ruined that you worked hard to keep clean! ABC Financial - the corporation doing the billing for Retro has hundreds of bad reviews at BBB websites and Retro has disputes and low rating and well as at the customer affairs website, 148 1 star review speak for itself!</p>
<p>I joined a local Retro Fitness in NJ while I was a part time college student at Rutgers University. I was told I could cancel in person at the gym when I returned back home to Pennsylvania. What a nightmare this has been. They told me I could not cancel at the gym, had to send a certified letter to the company. Tried that, no response. Tried sending a certified letter to their business office "ABC Financial", no response. I gave up trying to communicate with them as I did not have time to continue to send certified letters or drive back to NJ to settle this.</p>
<p>"This contract is subject to cancellation by notice sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or personally delivered to the Retro Fitness Baymeadows, 9802 Baymeadows Rd., Suite#5, Jacksonville, FL 32256 upon the member's change of permanent residence to a location more than 20 miles from the club or an affiliated health club offering the same or similar services and facilities at no additional expense to the Member." I tried cancelling but they don't respond to cancellation request sent via certified mail. Not even a reason as to why they won't cancel.</p>
<p>(FOREST HILLS NEW YORK UNION TURNPIKE LOCATION) Signed up few months ago for a MONTHLY membership. Did not want to be part of the gym for no more than 1 month. Matter of fact, I did not even use their facility ONCE after I signed up even for that 1 month I wanted. I came back from my vacation couple weeks ago to find out they had me sign a YEARLY contract that I NEVER wanted. Manager Alexandra, owner, district manager and head of customer experience John-Michael are not taking care of my matter. When a client from ANY business wants to talk to the district manager for a problem, businesses take it serious. Not this one. I understand every Retro is personally owned and operated. But, you are carrying the Retro Fitness name therefore I hold the entire company liable. Do not recommend any location.</p>
<p>Retro Fitness has proven to be one of the worst gym experiences of my life. AS per their policy, I notified them 60 days in advance to tell them of my termination of membership. This was in November of 2017. In late December or early January I began receive numerous phone calls daily from ABC Financial Services telling me that I have an outstanding balance of app. $61.00. Apparently, Retro Fitness had charged me for the months of December and January. When I spoke with a representative from ABC Financial Services they basically told me I need to resolve this with Retro Fitness. I went over to the Park Slope location in Brooklyn and spoke with the manager and a desk clerk lady. George, the manager, told me that I needed to pay 31.33 and the matter would be taken care of.</p>
<p>When I inquired for Retro Fitness they were to notify me when opening which was a year later in August. They never did. In Sept of 2017 they took out 99.00, Oct 99.00, Nov 99.00. Well December they debit 159.00. I call them to ask why I was being charged and ask why this wasn’t canceled. I have never been there yet was charged for tanning bed I never used, a trainer I never had. I have yet to be in store in Gloucester Twp Retro Fitness. I was told it would be taken care of. It never was. I called bank and had money returned and stopped. Now ABC Financial is calling me 8 times a day. Oh and membership was only suppose to be 30.00 month. I asked for proof I was there. Other place scan your card or you sign. I did neither cause I never was there. They need to stop. Now I’m in credit bureau but I’m disputing it and asking for proof I made these charges. Still no reply it’s been 3 months.</p>
<p>Joining the gym, very easy. Cancelling or getting someone on phone/someone from corporate to contact about customer service... Impossible! November 2017 I saw online via the new owners that the Retro in Bellmawr NJ was closing. I saved all the images and articles about the closure and the new gym and contacted customer service via their website. Emails were successfully sent however no one got back to me. December 1, 2017 I am charged my monthly fee and the maintenance fee. December 6, 2017 I receive email from Retro of Bellmawr stating they are closed. December 6, 2017 receive email from Retro Corp, saying that Bellmawr closed suddenly, they had NO idea and I was being routed to another location. HMMM... I have proof you knew in November it's not sudden!</p>
<p>I was overcharged after cancellation of my personal trainer Retro Fitness gym in New Springfield SI NY. It's out of the manager hands and it's the district managers who have to handle it. They keep telling me there is no new updates. When asked for a contact number I was told they are unable to give out his number. I called and emailed corporate. No help from them.</p>
<p>I was a member of Retro Fitness since Aug. 24, 2016. It didn't take long to realize I no longer wanted to use the services provided by these facilities. Their customer service and how misinformation and "take advantage" tactics gave me a bad taste. Prior to my 1 year mark, my wife and I, went to the franchise that we originally signed up with and they said, "Sorry, nothing we can do until Aug. 2017." </p>
<p>I have medical reason, I try to cancel membership with Retro Fitness at Hudson Mall in Jersey City but they still charging me. I already dispute the money from my credit card so now they're treating me to destroy my credit.</p>
<p>I called to cancel my membership for medical reason. They refused to cancel and told me they were going to continue racking up charges to ruin my credit. Also I started my account at 5 pm on the 9th of the month. At 1 am on every 9th they charge my card. If you haven't transferred funds yet because it's the middle of the night and technically you still have 16 hours until it's due they will double charge you for late fees. Their membership is 20 dollars and their late fee is 20 dollar even when you still have an entire day to pay it. What kind of scam is that.</p>
<p>My wife joined Retro Fitness with good intentions. She signed a piece of paper that evidently committed her to a whole year of hell. She started out, was supposed to meet with a trainer, and was disappointed that the trainer cancelled. Then she tried going to the place to do some exercise, and was quickly disappointed in the treatment of customers. The trainer never met with her, she got no instruction in how to use the equipment, and generally had no satisfaction with the company. She has attempted to contact the management to cancel her membership. No help there, she had more problems. They kept repeating that it was her fault, that she had to pay the money through the whole contract. They charge more fees all the time, use a collection agency to harass their customers, and the whole business appears to be a total rip-off. Beware!</p>
<p>Joining the gym was super easy. The personal training was a nightmare. Trainers canceling and rescheduling. I paid my obligation for personal training. Now I can't cancel the membership without paying an annual fee, going there in person, writing a letter sent certified mail, and am told if I do not pay the fee they will not cancel and I will continue to be billed! DO NOT JOIN WITHOUT READING FINE PRINT! Terrible customer service.</p>
<p>Retro Fitness in Flemington NJ. I'm glad I'm no longer a member here. While the gym itself is nice and I like the people I workout with, I have to say that during a difficult time with a personal information, they decided to charge us many late fees even though payments were made in cash. But even a few days after the payment date, they like to charge the $19.50 late fee. I wouldn't recommend this gym at all. They claim to want to help but when it comes to money - they have no problems sucking you dry.</p>
<p>When I initially signed up for my membership in November 2015, I was under the impression that there was no contracts like the email had stated. However, when I tried to cancel 45 days later because I had become pregnant, I was told that I could not cancel until I have waited a year because I was binded into a contract. However, the emails sent stated there were no contract, no enrollment fees, no annual fee, etc. However, because I was pregnant, I sent my doctors note and they had frozen my account from Feb 2016 to Sep 2016. I had only went to that gym once during my membership. I decided to go and close the account on July 15, 2017 and was told that I have to wait 21 days for them to cancel my membership and that I would be charged another month's fee on the 24th of July and an annual fee on the 1st of August. </p>
<p>I read all of the terrible reviews about Retro Fitness and their billing but I opted to give them a shot. INSTANT REGRET. I even got a personal trainer. ANOTHER INSTANT REGRET. These bastards will do literally anything to get a dollar. I specifically stated that I did not want to be auto enrolled after my six month personal training and one year gym membership expired. Well, here I am still being charged and still being given the run around!!! I cannot believe I was dumb enough to trust these scoundrels. I have been calling regarding this issue for two months, if not more, and I have been told "Someone will be getting back to me"... No one has bothered to contact me but they sure did charge me this month!!! Unreal. If you choose to join this gym, do yourself a favor and DO NOT pay on your credit cards or debit cards. They WILL auto enroll you and they won't give you your money back or stop the charges.</p>
<p>A dear friend of mine who also happens to be an unemployed Veteran has moved out of NY and has tried to cancel his membership as per their website, by email as he lives in Florida now and is unable to Fly to NY JUST To cancel a GYM MEMBERSHIP. The RETRO FITNESS in WEST BABYLON Manager Audrey ** has refused to assist him with this situation and continues to insist it is her right to not agree to the email cancellation policy of the company, each Franchise can do what they please. SHAME ON THIS WOMAN for being difficult and uncooperative, just because she can. From the other reviews I have read I would say this particular business is a HUGE mark on the reputation of Retro Fitness in general and they should consider retraining her or revoking her franchise.</p>
<p>When I joined in January of this year, the coupon said no enrollment fees, no contracts. When I submitted my letter advising that I wished to cancel (giving them 60 days notice as specified in my agreement sent by CERTIFIED mail as required) I received a phone call today advising me that I was locked in a year contract. I insisted that there was no way I was informed of any contract, because there wouldn't be a chance in hell that I would have agreed to one. So basically they will continue to bill me $19.99 a month until the end of this year. Very shady bogus business. I will continue to fight but seems almost useless. I will NEVER recommend this facility. It's a rip off.</p>
<p>So my complaint has to do with my gym membership. I was with fitness plus when Retro Fitness took it over about a year and a half ago. I had been with fitness plus since 2007. I canceled my membership on December 31, 2016. I had called the previous week before, around the 18th and spoke to the manager, Wilson. I asked him if I can close my membership and he said sure he just have to come in and sign a document. I asked him when I can come in do it, and he said I had to come in when he was there. I work 8 to 6 Monday through Friday, and he is there those hours during the day. The next time I was able to go was December 31 which is a Saturday. So I went in there on December 31 and asked to cancel my contract. This is what I was told that it was required to have 45 days to cancel my contract. He had said that I was gonna get charge for the month of January. He said the payment was gonna come out on January 6.</p>
[<p>Worst fitness ever, bad management, horrible people, and very racist. They will keep charging you even after you tell them you want to cancel. I told them I want to cancel my account because they treated me very bad and most of the machines are not working most of the time, and when I told them they said, "Ok but you have to pay 70% of what is remaining." I was like, "How does that make sense to pay 70% of the remaining monthly payments when I’m not gonna come anymore," they said it’s in the contract! Even that no one said anything when I was signing the contract, then I said, "Ok I’ll keep it and try to make a lemonade out of the lemon," but then few months later it gets worse so I was like, "No that’s enough. I don’t want to go to this place anymore."</p>, <p>There were two Retro Fitness locations that were convenient when I signed up at Retro 2 years ago, one near my home and one near work. Both locations are now closed. The one near my house closed on 24 December 2018. Now Retro will not let me cancel my automatic deduction from my credit card. I am told that I have to go to where I signed up... Duh the location that I signed up at IS NOW CLOSED. Just a bunch of crooks.</p>, <p>Retro Fitness in Oceanside, NY is a scam! If I could give ZERO stars- I would!! First off- SCAM. My credit card numbers were in someone else’s account and after $336.89 in charges on someone’s else’s account, Retro Fitness and their third party account memberships management, ABC Financial DECLINED to issue me a refund and fix this error. I know that it was an error with their membership account services / set up and they refuse to resolve this and basically told me to, "**, we are keeping your $336.89." If that’s not horrible customer service, what is? </p>, <p>I requested to cancel my membership which I was told to give it in written and said will be charged for next 3 months because we cancelled the contract. We agreed to pay 3 months and cancelled. Now it's been 5th month getting charged and talked to manager and he said the guy with whom we cancelled didn't gave you correct information and said we will be charged until 1 year.</p>, <p>I cancelled my membership on a third day I signed a contract (May 29h 2018). Just came to the gym on Y Avenue (325 Ave Y Brooklyn NY 11223 ) and told manager (don't recall his exact name **- gingerish guy with a beard) that I am done with them. I asked do I have to sign anything, he responded, "No, it's ok." I just need to give my name and my retro card, so I did. After a month I noticed that card was charged about $63. I called to the gym/to ABC. They responded it was just some maintenance fee that I had to pay anyway. WTF?! Moreover, I figured out that my membership was not canceled but frozen. I WAS NEVER TOLD ABOUT IT!!! </p>, <p>My 17 year old daughter joined Retro Fitness in Lincroft NJ when she began working/driving. They happily took her sign up fee and credit card information to bill her on a regular basis. Almost a year later, she was getting ready to leave for college. We needed to cancel her membership. I called the gym, asked for the manager so I could discuss my daughter's membership cancellation. The guy that answered the phone said that, Kathleen, wasn't available and that I needed to put my request in the form of a letter and send it in. Following instructions, I typed a letter on my daughter's behalf and walked it into the gym the next day. I asked for the manager and was told that she wasn't there. This was the second time the manager wasn't around. </p>, <p>Well, I guess it has been said enough already by other reviewers. I just agree with everything. It is a money making scheme run by greedy corporation. Yes, you will join in a second for $19.99 a month. But then they will start billing you all kinds of fees including their beloved $42 annual fee (for what???). I went to the gym directly, made them give me a copy of cancellation request and double checked again in a few days. Make sure you talk to a manager and not just to a cute young lady at the service desk. Still they charged me annual fee, but I am happy I got out from that terrible establishment. I also put my credit card on freeze so those crooks would not keep charging me.</p>, <p>I had been a member here since they opened their doors, I can't tell you how many times the toilets, elevators and exercise equipment has been broken or in need of cleaning. On top of that, although I went into the club three times to cancel my daughter's membership before she went to college, nobody at the front desk could manage to do it properly, which led to me continuing to be charged monthly and annual fees! When I went in again to speak to the staff, it was as if they'd never seen me before! Nobody had any recollection of me trying desperately to close her account, so I was basically told to go fly a kite. The manager actually offered to cancel my membership! What a way to treat clients.</p>, <p>I got sick and moved 2000 miles away from the club and they are forcing me to pay 6 months trainer sessions to the tune of $165 a month even with proof from the doctor and my mailing address. Stay away. Not worth the hassle.</p>, <p>After notifying Retro Fitness of my medical reasons for having to take time off from my program (hip replacement). I was told my account was FROZEN, my credit card was billed $280.00. I cancelled the card immediately. I approached Ms ** and was told it was a billing error. The following month they attempted to bill my card another $280.00 on the frozen account. After numerous calls with no return calls I was told by their representative that I was reimbursed for the $ 280.00 and Quote "she was tired of this ** and she would have Ms. ** call me." No Call. I have now filed a claim in court to get my money back. They also have a collection agency trying to get $199.00 from me on monthly dues on the FROZEN ACCOUNT. A firm warning stay away from this sleazy underhanded, LYING outfit.</p>, <p>They make it impossible to cancel your account - so many hoops to jump through. This should be a simple process. If you do to want a product or service, you can get out. Terrible customer experience. DO NOT JOIN THIS CLUB, you will have a difficult time getting out. Between my wife and my accounts, I feel like Retro Fitness (New City) stole over 2 years of money from my family. $19.99 x 2 = $39.98 a month at 2 years is $959.52 for nothing. Someone needs to do something about this gym. They take advantage of customers.</p>, <p>Bad customer service - the membership contract is set up to make sure you have a most difficulty to cancel and if you make any mistake sending your Certified Mail cancellation, your credit is ruined that you worked hard to keep clean! ABC Financial - the corporation doing the billing for Retro has hundreds of bad reviews at BBB websites and Retro has disputes and low rating and well as at the customer affairs website, 148 1 star review speak for itself!</p>, <p>I joined a local Retro Fitness in NJ while I was a part time college student at Rutgers University. I was told I could cancel in person at the gym when I returned back home to Pennsylvania. What a nightmare this has been. They told me I could not cancel at the gym, had to send a certified letter to the company. Tried that, no response. Tried sending a certified letter to their business office "ABC Financial", no response. I gave up trying to communicate with them as I did not have time to continue to send certified letters or drive back to NJ to settle this.</p>, <p>"This contract is subject to cancellation by notice sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or personally delivered to the Retro Fitness Baymeadows, 9802 Baymeadows Rd., Suite#5, Jacksonville, FL 32256 upon the member's change of permanent residence to a location more than 20 miles from the club or an affiliated health club offering the same or similar services and facilities at no additional expense to the Member." I tried cancelling but they don't respond to cancellation request sent via certified mail. Not even a reason as to why they won't cancel.</p>, <p>(FOREST HILLS NEW YORK UNION TURNPIKE LOCATION) Signed up few months ago for a MONTHLY membership. Did not want to be part of the gym for no more than 1 month. Matter of fact, I did not even use their facility ONCE after I signed up even for that 1 month I wanted. I came back from my vacation couple weeks ago to find out they had me sign a YEARLY contract that I NEVER wanted. Manager Alexandra, owner, district manager and head of customer experience John-Michael are not taking care of my matter. When a client from ANY business wants to talk to the district manager for a problem, businesses take it serious. Not this one. I understand every Retro is personally owned and operated. But, you are carrying the Retro Fitness name therefore I hold the entire company liable. Do not recommend any location.</p>, <p>Retro Fitness has proven to be one of the worst gym experiences of my life. AS per their policy, I notified them 60 days in advance to tell them of my termination of membership. This was in November of 2017. In late December or early January I began receive numerous phone calls daily from ABC Financial Services telling me that I have an outstanding balance of app. $61.00. Apparently, Retro Fitness had charged me for the months of December and January. When I spoke with a representative from ABC Financial Services they basically told me I need to resolve this with Retro Fitness. I went over to the Park Slope location in Brooklyn and spoke with the manager and a desk clerk lady. George, the manager, told me that I needed to pay 31.33 and the matter would be taken care of.</p>, <p>When I inquired for Retro Fitness they were to notify me when opening which was a year later in August. They never did. In Sept of 2017 they took out 99.00, Oct 99.00, Nov 99.00. Well December they debit 159.00. I call them to ask why I was being charged and ask why this wasn’t canceled. I have never been there yet was charged for tanning bed I never used, a trainer I never had. I have yet to be in store in Gloucester Twp Retro Fitness. I was told it would be taken care of. It never was. I called bank and had money returned and stopped. Now ABC Financial is calling me 8 times a day. Oh and membership was only suppose to be 30.00 month. I asked for proof I was there. Other place scan your card or you sign. I did neither cause I never was there. They need to stop. Now I’m in credit bureau but I’m disputing it and asking for proof I made these charges. Still no reply it’s been 3 months.</p>, <p>Joining the gym, very easy. Cancelling or getting someone on phone/someone from corporate to contact about customer service... Impossible! November 2017 I saw online via the new owners that the Retro in Bellmawr NJ was closing. I saved all the images and articles about the closure and the new gym and contacted customer service via their website. Emails were successfully sent however no one got back to me. December 1, 2017 I am charged my monthly fee and the maintenance fee. December 6, 2017 I receive email from Retro of Bellmawr stating they are closed. December 6, 2017 receive email from Retro Corp, saying that Bellmawr closed suddenly, they had NO idea and I was being routed to another location. HMMM... I have proof you knew in November it's not sudden!</p>, <p>I was overcharged after cancellation of my personal trainer Retro Fitness gym in New Springfield SI NY. It's out of the manager hands and it's the district managers who have to handle it. They keep telling me there is no new updates. When asked for a contact number I was told they are unable to give out his number. I called and emailed corporate. No help from them.</p>, <p>I was a member of Retro Fitness since Aug. 24, 2016. It didn't take long to realize I no longer wanted to use the services provided by these facilities. Their customer service and how misinformation and "take advantage" tactics gave me a bad taste. Prior to my 1 year mark, my wife and I, went to the franchise that we originally signed up with and they said, "Sorry, nothing we can do until Aug. 2017." </p>, <p>I have medical reason, I try to cancel membership with Retro Fitness at Hudson Mall in Jersey City but they still charging me. I already dispute the money from my credit card so now they're treating me to destroy my credit.</p>, <p>I called to cancel my membership for medical reason. They refused to cancel and told me they were going to continue racking up charges to ruin my credit. Also I started my account at 5 pm on the 9th of the month. At 1 am on every 9th they charge my card. If you haven't transferred funds yet because it's the middle of the night and technically you still have 16 hours until it's due they will double charge you for late fees. Their membership is 20 dollars and their late fee is 20 dollar even when you still have an entire day to pay it. What kind of scam is that.</p>, <p>My wife joined Retro Fitness with good intentions. She signed a piece of paper that evidently committed her to a whole year of hell. She started out, was supposed to meet with a trainer, and was disappointed that the trainer cancelled. Then she tried going to the place to do some exercise, and was quickly disappointed in the treatment of customers. The trainer never met with her, she got no instruction in how to use the equipment, and generally had no satisfaction with the company. She has attempted to contact the management to cancel her membership. No help there, she had more problems. They kept repeating that it was her fault, that she had to pay the money through the whole contract. They charge more fees all the time, use a collection agency to harass their customers, and the whole business appears to be a total rip-off. Beware!</p>, <p>Joining the gym was super easy. The personal training was a nightmare. Trainers canceling and rescheduling. I paid my obligation for personal training. Now I can't cancel the membership without paying an annual fee, going there in person, writing a letter sent certified mail, and am told if I do not pay the fee they will not cancel and I will continue to be billed! DO NOT JOIN WITHOUT READING FINE PRINT! Terrible customer service.</p>, <p>Retro Fitness in Flemington NJ. I'm glad I'm no longer a member here. While the gym itself is nice and I like the people I workout with, I have to say that during a difficult time with a personal information, they decided to charge us many late fees even though payments were made in cash. But even a few days after the payment date, they like to charge the $19.50 late fee. I wouldn't recommend this gym at all. They claim to want to help but when it comes to money - they have no problems sucking you dry.</p>, <p>When I initially signed up for my membership in November 2015, I was under the impression that there was no contracts like the email had stated. However, when I tried to cancel 45 days later because I had become pregnant, I was told that I could not cancel until I have waited a year because I was binded into a contract.

<p>They will NOT change the Music. Constant - Gang Music or Music for Girls that scream during the entire day and night! Very annoying! I am not renewing... for all of you considering - headphones or do not bother.</p>
<p>I tried canceling my membership because I had moved away and informed the club of this. I talked to a Taylor that worked there and had signed me up for my membership and she said she would get it taken care of. I kept receiving mail saying that I didn't pay my membership and I called them and they said that there was no note in the system to be canceled and Taylor does not work there anymore. They also informed me that it could not be canceled early. I was not informed of this when signing up and sped through the signup process. I called and tried talking to a manager and they were not there and I could not get the schedule of the manager to call back and talk to them.</p>
<p>Beware of Retro Fitness. I signed up and was hastily sped through "click to agree" questions on an iPad, unknowingly agreeing to an optional 9.99/month group fitness fee. When I called Corporate I was told to contact the club. I went to the Retro Fitness Wilmington, Kirkwood Highway club on Friday 12/9 at 3:30 PM and was told by a young lady working the desk to call back tomorrow from 1-5 when the manager Mike was working, and that he would gladly remove it. I was told that this fee was happening to many members. I called today and was told by Mike that this was something explained to me, that I agreed to, and that he WOULD NOT remove the fee. I am totally disgusted by these sly business practices and the outright lie that their desk representatives are saying to their customers. And to think, I paid a cancellation fee to Planet Fitness for this place, not knowing they would try to screw me in the end!</p>
<p>I paid my membership and I am not being allowed to enter the gym. They popped up with a yearly fee and then tried to tack on an extra 20 dollar late fee the same day it was due. I called the operator. Said he fixed the problem but he didn't know I am barred from the gym. I paid my membership for another week at least. I can't even call and fix it because the office is closed on the weekends. This is unacceptable. I paid and I am being refused entry. I have been a customer here for years and I pay 2 memberships. This is unacceptable I am about to close both accounts. This is no way to run a business.</p>
<p>I walked into the Retro Fitness club to sign up for a regular routine exercise. The guy at the counter brought me into the small dark room to talk to the manager, Joseph **. Joseph convinced me to "try out" the personal training for $145 a month. I agreed to try and sign only one last page (I wasn't aware of that) in the total darkness while being exposed to some personal conversations about Joseph's motivations, problems, and personal details I didn't care about for a split second. He didn't give me the copy and said I'd receive it via email. When I recovered the email which went directly to Spam, it was too late to cancel as they only give you 3 days to change your mind about the membership. Only later I understood why Joe ** wouldn't stop talking - it was an old brilliantly dishonest sales trick to distract my attention away from the services and plan, and focus it on immediate payment. </p>
<p>To anyone and everyone wishing to join Retro Fitness and their partner ABC Financial think very hard about this decision. When you join they make it seem so easy that in the event you wish to cancel all you need to do is contact ABC Financial and you're done. You need to send a certified letter explaining why and even then it takes a number of monthly cycles before it actually cancels. Why does this have to occur... why won't e-mail work? Why... because they manage to squeeze out a couple more months before that occurs.</p>
<p>I cancelled my gym membership due to moving away from the facility. I was told that if I brought in proof of cancellation by the first of the month I would not be charged on the 4th. I drove across town to make it in time and provided the proper documentation. The gentleman that took care of me assured me that if I received a charge for the 4th of the month, to contact the manager. I indeed received a charge. </p>
<p>These people will give you hell to cancel the membership. You have to send a certified letter to cancel and after few months they will put you in collection. Me and my wife have canceled it together. They canceled hers and did not cancel mine without telling me anything and then they put me in collections for 100 bucks, unreal and then you can’t talk to anyone. They never pick up the phones.</p>
<p>I went to Retro Fitness in Deerfield Park Avenue for a session cause I signed up to join the gym. The person that I have the session with was a personal trainer there. He was telling if I joined it could help listen to him talking. I say "ok let me try it for 6 months to see how it goes." He told me he was going to sent me in email so I could set up my session. Never get it. When I call to speak to the trainer that was supposed to be the manager of the gym they always say it going to call me back which he never did. He was supposed to give me a copy of the contract. He never give it to me... so I ask to cancel. My contact information was informed her was the only that could cancel the contract by one of the worker...</p>
<p>This particular facility in Fairfield is managed by those with little concern for the satisfaction of its clients. In particular in the area of membership, the individuals managing are masters in the skill set of deceit and manipulation. I have attended the facility in Belleville and can state that this is no better except that this gym does not pretend to care so you are not misled. You can either put up with it or not. </p>
<p>My Brother received a Gift Certificate for Olympic Torch App Challenge Winner. When we presented the certificate to the manager of our location, he had no knowledge of what he should do with the certificate. It gives my Brother six months free membership. How can a company have an individual(s) running a site and he/she has no knowledge of the promotions the company offers? Tried reaching out to the Corporate Office just to find out all mailboxes are full. What kind of company is this?</p>
<p>My membership was due to renew in June and I called/emailed Retro in April to cancel my membership. I received an email that same day stating my membership was cancelled and my last payment would be June 6th. Well, since then, I've received charges on my credit card for the annual fee of $39 plus charges for the month of July and August. My husband disputed the charges with our credit card company. Now I'm receiving harassing mail, emails and phone calls about my account being delinquent. ABC Financial said they have no record of the cancellation, so I forwarded them a copy of the email. This still has not stopped them from calling/emailing. I told them that I contacted my lawyer. Did they care? No! I don't understand how the BB doesn't get involved with this business, since this is an ongoing problem.</p>
<p>I was a member of Retro Fitness and they are running a strange program. First a few months after joining the White Flint area location also some may call it Kensington they had an open house. I won a contest and was told that I had won a free lifetime membership and later switched up and said it was for a year and later I was told it would only good for six months free. That was it for me and I told them that when the six months was up I was done. I stop going and they would not close my account. They were not helpful or polite. Then they tell me that I have to pay two more months to get out of the gym membership. They will not get another dime from me. If you are smart don't join. You will regret it. I am going to take legal action if they don't get this garbage solved!</p>
<p>When I first went to Retro Fitness, I got interested because of the price and the convenient location close to work. I got a deal for $20 a month. When I was signing up, I asked if it was a contract, and they said no. (My mistake, I should have read the fine lines.) After 3-4 months, I wanted to switch gym and went to cancel the direct payments, I was told I would have to wait 1 year to do so because it was a contract. </p>
<p>I wish I had read these reviews. I had a similar with cancellation and billing. First, I was told by the gym that I could not continue to use the gym if I canceled before the last day I used the gym, even if I had already paid for the month. Next, after I was charged a cancellation fee and canceled my membership, the gym charged me for that month. I disputed the issue with American Express. They sent over a contract stating that I need to cancel 30 days in advance. I had American Express place a block on the vendor, but I am still having issues contacting the billing office. The staff at the gym I use said they couldn't help me and I need to contact corporate directly.</p>
<p>I have read many complaints against Retro Fitness for the same reason. My son signed a year contract and they renewed it without his consent. I had tried to cancel it for months before and was totally misinformed. No one knows what their policy is there. They are all clueless. Even when I went to the club after receiving a letter from a collection agency, the manager told me should would cancel it, but she never did! I am paying the damn amount owed as I want Eric ** from the collections to stop calling me but this place should be shut down. Do NOT sign a contract with them, it is a scam.</p>
<p>This place is a big joke and no one is doing nothing about this. I don't think is cool getting ripped off by these clowns. It is such a process just to cancel. I tried to cancel my account. I called and was told to email them with my name and number and they will cancel it, that was 3 days ago after they charged me a $41.73 fee and was told that this is a yearly fee to guarantee that my monthly payment will stay at $21.52. Guess what? My card was just charged $21.52 after a supposed cancellation... with all these bad reviews and these bloodsuckers are just ripping people off and it seems to be ok. I do not understand why this is not being addressed.</p>
<p>Joined Retro last summer. Fulfilled contract. Sent certified LOC to ABC Financial, membership was NOT to RENEW. Well, I am still being charged for TANNING - and late charges because I am no longer a member &amp; threatened by ABC Financial for Collections! Apparently in your LOC you are suppose to specify you would like TANNING, CHILDCARE, AND YOUR MEMBERSHIP cancelled. You cannot just write: "I would like to cancel my membership." You have to specify all the items you would like or you will continue to be charged for whatever you don't specify. SCAM!!! We have got an attorney - although we don't have a case - because they don't let you read the fine print when you sign up on an IPAD!</p>
<p>Retro Fitness in ASTON is an absolute scam and should be embarrassed how they treat their paying clients. I have paid my contract (a year obligation) even though I have only been there probably 5 times... understanding I signed a YEAR contract. I call the Studio in ASTON to CANCEL... My year contract is up. They cant do it.</p>
<p>THE OWNER SHOULD BE IN JAIL. THEY WILL NOT LET ME CANCEL. I have been trying to cancel my membership for TEN MONTHS. Each time I sign a document stating that I will be charged for one additional month after my cancellation request (Fine. Not fine but fine) and then that will be my final payment. Then miraculously each time after that final payment date, I am still being charged months after!!! This happened 2 times already. Finally, I get someone to say I am finally eligible to cancel my membership. I make sure all my auto-renewals are turned off (I was looked in the eye and told auto renewal was off). I make sure I sign ANOTHER one of those damn papers that say I will owe only one additional payment and then my membership expires as of 4/23/16. Guess what? It's July and I was charged each month after April.</p>
<p>I have been at this gym for over ten years. It was sold and now there has been a new owner since Dec. 2014. Since that time, I and members have been told repeatedly that the gym is going to be totally revamped "soon." Nothing has been done. Members have been told a smoothie bar and cardio theater is coming. Their website states that we already have this in the gym. All lies and false advertising! Treadmills and cardio equipment is broken and not fixed. When I or members tell the manager, he says that he will take care of it but nothing happens. This has been going on since this new owner has taken over. He is rarely in the gym. I don't care about a smoothie bar but just take care of what is in the gym! </p>
<p>When we signed up for Retro Fitness we specified it was only for one year, as it was just for physical therapy after an operation I had. I was not notified in any way that the contract would be automatically renewed and when they drew up the contract it was done on a tablet not on paper. We looked at the contract and there was nothing on it about automatic renewal.</p>
<p>I joined Retro Fitness in late 2012, early 2013. Everything was fine. Fast forward to January 2014, I was asked if I wanted to get a free personal training session. I agreed and figured that it would be good for me to try the personal training. When signing up for the personal training sessions with Terry **, I mentioned that it was free and what a condescending attitude he had, saying that it was not free, but complimentary. I said they told me it was free, and he said they never said that. I should have ran then, but I was naive and I signed up anyway. When I trained with him, he told me to warm up on the treadmill or elliptical for five minutes. When I was done with the warm-up, I would find him signing more people up and I had to wait for him. During the sessions he kept looking at his watch and saying to do a set of ten reps of whatever exercise it was and he would be right back.</p>
<p>No one cleans the equipment when they're done using it. I just watch people on their phone texting just sitting on the machines sweating and it's gross. I have become ill on more than one occasion actually losing time from work. I make sure I properly clean the machines before and after I use them but it's not enough. The tanning machine is disgusting. I don't think that it's ever been cleaned and snooty girl at front desk had nerve to ask me if I had my eyewear!</p>
<p>Horrible gym! Canceled my gym membership in Jan. 2016. Sent a letter certified with the agreed upon final payment. They continued to bill me and sent my account to collections.</p>
<p>I signed up with this gym late last year. To my surprise I didn't know there would be so many issues with this gym until I started looking into getting personal training for the first time. Though I'm not new to fitness I had never had a personal trainer before and I needed to learned many things on working out with those machines in there, proper technique, etc. I was first appointed to a trainer I thought was a good trainer after watching with his clients so many times before asking for his help, might be a good one to start out with. But boy was I in for a treat, he seemed to know somewhat on working out but lack a lot of skills in trainer female clients. He would give me same old workouts, rotating them with other clients that were men. When I asked him many times to show me other things with machines or workouts for the female anatomy, only thing he would say is "We are all the same". Huh! </p>
<p>I joined this club because my family are members. I am currently a member at another club where I do many spin classes. This was going to be my "fill-in" club. I found the manager to be condescending toward older people. He mentioned, when I told him, that I was interested in the spin classes that the "music gets kind of loud". When I mentioned that I am not tech savvy and would like to call to reserve my bike, as I do in the other club, where I take 8 class in 5 days, he said that would be fine. After being a member for a month and a half my bike, that I had phoned in for, was not reserved. The manager said that the policy was changed and there would be no more calling in. When I informed him that I had a one year verbal agreement, he said he did not care and the rules were changed and he said he was canceling my contract. I would not recommend this club to anyone.</p>
<p>This is the Retro located in East Brunswick, NJ. The music that is played between the hours of 5 am to 2 pm shift is outdated like from the 50s. The counter person is older than my grandma. I figure to see some nice young girls to greet me and it's the total opposite. Also it's always very hot and smells bad.</p>
<p>I have been a customer of Retro Fitness, Clark NJ for quite some time. But, in the past year I have hardly used my membership. Imagine my surprise when I notified them in person today that I want to drop my membership and was informed that they will continue to bill me for 60 days! And that the contract I originally signed explained that fact. Believe me, had I known that I would never have signed up with them. And had I read reviews such as on this website I would never have signed up with them.</p>
<p>I am so disappointed with this gym and customer service is horrible. Please think twice before you sign the paper because you are about to be a victim of a major financial crime. I REPEAT, DO NOT JOIN THIS GYM. Everything was good until I tried to cancel my personal training membership. I have been trying to get the withdrawals stopped from my account for several months. They just don't seem to be able to remove me from their billing system. They continued to charge my account even after my membership ended. They refused to give me a refund for services I did not received.</p>
[<p>They will NOT change the Music. Constant - Gang Music or Music for Girls that scream during the entire day and night! Very annoying! I am not renewing... for all of you considering - headphones or do not bother.</p>, <p>I tried canceling my membership because I had moved away and informed the club of this. I talked to a Taylor that worked there and had signed me up for my membership and she said she would get it taken care of. I kept receiving mail saying that I didn't pay my membership and I called them and they said that there was no note in the system to be canceled and Taylor does not work there anymore. They also informed me that it could not be canceled early. I was not informed of this when signing up and sped through the signup process. I called and tried talking to a manager and they were not there and I could not get the schedule of the manager to call back and talk to them.</p>, <p>Beware of Retro Fitness. I signed up and was hastily sped through "click to agree" questions on an iPad, unknowingly agreeing to an optional 9.99/month group fitness fee. When I called Corporate I was told to contact the club. I went to the Retro Fitness Wilmington, Kirkwood Highway club on Friday 12/9 at 3:30 PM and was told by a young lady working the desk to call back tomorrow from 1-5 when the manager Mike was working, and that he would gladly remove it. I was told that this fee was happening to many members. I called today and was told by Mike that this was something explained to me, that I agreed to, and that he WOULD NOT remove the fee. I am totally disgusted by these sly business practices and the outright lie that their desk representatives are saying to their customers. And to think, I paid a cancellation fee to Planet Fitness for this place, not knowing they would try to screw me in the end!</p>, <p>I paid my membership and I am not being allowed to enter the gym. They popped up with a yearly fee and then tried to tack on an extra 20 dollar late fee the same day it was due. I called the operator. Said he fixed the problem but he didn't know I am barred from the gym. I paid my membership for another week at least. I can't even call and fix it because the office is closed on the weekends. This is unacceptable. I paid and I am being refused entry. I have been a customer here for years and I pay 2 memberships. This is unacceptable I am about to close both accounts. This is no way to run a business.</p>, <p>I walked into the Retro Fitness club to sign up for a regular routine exercise. The guy at the counter brought me into the small dark room to talk to the manager, Joseph **. Joseph convinced me to "try out" the personal training for $145 a month. I agreed to try and sign only one last page (I wasn't aware of that) in the total darkness while being exposed to some personal conversations about Joseph's motivations, problems, and personal details I didn't care about for a split second. He didn't give me the copy and said I'd receive it via email. When I recovered the email which went directly to Spam, it was too late to cancel as they only give you 3 days to change your mind about the membership. Only later I understood why Joe ** wouldn't stop talking - it was an old brilliantly dishonest sales trick to distract my attention away from the services and plan, and focus it on immediate payment. </p>, <p>To anyone and everyone wishing to join Retro Fitness and their partner ABC Financial think very hard about this decision. When you join they make it seem so easy that in the event you wish to cancel all you need to do is contact ABC Financial and you're done. You need to send a certified letter explaining why and even then it takes a number of monthly cycles before it actually cancels. Why does this have to occur... why won't e-mail work? Why... because they manage to squeeze out a couple more months before that occurs.</p>, <p>I cancelled my gym membership due to moving away from the facility. I was told that if I brought in proof of cancellation by the first of the month I would not be charged on the 4th. I drove across town to make it in time and provided the proper documentation. The gentleman that took care of me assured me that if I received a charge for the 4th of the month, to contact the manager. I indeed received a charge. </p>, <p>These people will give you hell to cancel the membership. You have to send a certified letter to cancel and after few months they will put you in collection. Me and my wife have canceled it together. They canceled hers and did not cancel mine without telling me anything and then they put me in collections for 100 bucks, unreal and then you can’t talk to anyone. They never pick up the phones.</p>, <p>I went to Retro Fitness in Deerfield Park Avenue for a session cause I signed up to join the gym. The person that I have the session with was a personal trainer there. He was telling if I joined it could help listen to him talking. I say "ok let me try it for 6 months to see how it goes." He told me he was going to sent me in email so I could set up my session. Never get it. When I call to speak to the trainer that was supposed to be the manager of the gym they always say it going to call me back which he never did. He was supposed to give me a copy of the contract. He never give it to me... so I ask to cancel. My contact information was informed her was the only that could cancel the contract by one of the worker...</p>, <p>This particular facility in Fairfield is managed by those with little concern for the satisfaction of its clients. In particular in the area of membership, the individuals managing are masters in the skill set of deceit and manipulation. I have attended the facility in Belleville and can state that this is no better except that this gym does not pretend to care so you are not misled. You can either put up with it or not. </p>, <p>My Brother received a Gift Certificate for Olympic Torch App Challenge Winner. When we presented the certificate to the manager of our location, he had no knowledge of what he should do with the certificate. It gives my Brother six months free membership. How can a company have an individual(s) running a site and he/she has no knowledge of the promotions the company offers? Tried reaching out to the Corporate Office just to find out all mailboxes are full. What kind of company is this?</p>, <p>My membership was due to renew in June and I called/emailed Retro in April to cancel my membership. I received an email that same day stating my membership was cancelled and my last payment would be June 6th. Well, since then, I've received charges on my credit card for the annual fee of $39 plus charges for the month of July and August. My husband disputed the charges with our credit card company. Now I'm receiving harassing mail, emails and phone calls about my account being delinquent. ABC Financial said they have no record of the cancellation, so I forwarded them a copy of the email. This still has not stopped them from calling/emailing. I told them that I contacted my lawyer. Did they care? No! I don't understand how the BB doesn't get involved with this business, since this is an ongoing problem.</p>, <p>I was a member of Retro Fitness and they are running a strange program. First a few months after joining the White Flint area location also some may call it Kensington they had an open house. I won a contest and was told that I had won a free lifetime membership and later switched up and said it was for a year and later I was told it would only good for six months free. That was it for me and I told them that when the six months was up I was done. I stop going and they would not close my account. They were not helpful or polite. Then they tell me that I have to pay two more months to get out of the gym membership. They will not get another dime from me. If you are smart don't join. You will regret it. I am going to take legal action if they don't get this garbage solved!</p>, <p>When I first went to Retro Fitness, I got interested because of the price and the convenient location close to work. I got a deal for $20 a month. When I was signing up, I asked if it was a contract, and they said no. (My mistake, I should have read the fine lines.) After 3-4 months, I wanted to switch gym and went to cancel the direct payments, I was told I would have to wait 1 year to do so because it was a contract. </p>, <p>I wish I had read these reviews. I had a similar with cancellation and billing. First, I was told by the gym that I could not continue to use the gym if I canceled before the last day I used the gym, even if I had already paid for the month. Next, after I was charged a cancellation fee and canceled my membership, the gym charged me for that month. I disputed the issue with American Express. They sent over a contract stating that I need to cancel 30 days in advance. I had American Express place a block on the vendor, but I am still having issues contacting the billing office. The staff at the gym I use said they couldn't help me and I need to contact corporate directly.</p>, <p>I have read many complaints against Retro Fitness for the same reason. My son signed a year contract and they renewed it without his consent. I had tried to cancel it for months before and was totally misinformed. No one knows what their policy is there. They are all clueless. Even when I went to the club after receiving a letter from a collection agency, the manager told me should would cancel it, but she never did! I am paying the damn amount owed as I want Eric ** from the collections to stop calling me but this place should be shut down. Do NOT sign a contract with them, it is a scam.</p>, <p>This place is a big joke and no one is doing nothing about this. I don't think is cool getting ripped off by these clowns. It is such a process just to cancel. I tried to cancel my account. I called and was told to email them with my name and number and they will cancel it, that was 3 days ago after they charged me a $41.73 fee and was told that this is a yearly fee to guarantee that my monthly payment will stay at $21.52. Guess what? My card was just charged $21.52 after a supposed cancellation... with all these bad reviews and these bloodsuckers are just ripping people off and it seems to be ok. I do not understand why this is not being addressed.</p>, <p>Joined Retro last summer. Fulfilled contract. Sent certified LOC to ABC Financial, membership was NOT to RENEW. Well, I am still being charged for TANNING - and late charges because I am no longer a member &amp; threatened by ABC Financial for Collections! Apparently in your LOC you are suppose to specify you would like TANNING, CHILDCARE, AND YOUR MEMBERSHIP cancelled. You cannot just write: "I would like to cancel my membership." You have to specify all the items you would like or you will continue to be charged for whatever you don't specify. SCAM!!!

<p>Just joined Retro Neptune City. Paid for a full year. Paid for 24 strength training sessions. After one session was unable to access computer program (after multiple attempts) to set up future sessions. Advised facility of difficulty. Advised by employee, "Nothing has changed since you signed up." After the one training session I was advised by the trainer that he "would text" to set up the next session. Never heard from him. </p>
<p>I was a member of Retro Fitness in Flemington NJ for 3 years. It was a good experience until I tried to cancel my membership. I was told that it takes 60 days (2 months) to process the cancellation, during which time I would continue to be charged. I could still use the gym during that time, though... My question is: Why is it that when you join Retro Fitness your paperwork is processed immediately, however, it takes 2 months when you cancel??? Planet Fitness processes your cancellation immediately. Poor business practice Retro Fitness! If you treat your customers fairly, they may return.</p>
<p>I enrolled at Retro Fitness with my husband and 15 yr old son, thinking it was a nice place since it had opened not long ago. The first day we went to the gym was very disappointing. There wasn't machines like at Planet Fitness, and I felt violated, perverts just eyeing you made it very uncomfortable. I told my husband and we decided it was not a place for us. My husband went to cancel and was told No unless you have a medical condition. I fully understand the policy however, if we decided not to go they can charge some early cancelation fee and not force us to keep a contract for a whole yr charging the card. </p>
<p>The whole home gym crap is ridiculous. If I'm able to use any facility I should be able to pay my dues at any facility instead of being sent to a different city or state to do so. All payments are handled by ABC financial anyway. There is no actual way to get any customer service complaint resolved... At the Belleville NJ Retro, the staff refused to get a manager or provide contact info to reach him myself. This gym in particular is the biggest offender. I've had more issues before even starting my work out than here than any other. Poor customer service, severe lack of knowledge, nasty attitudes, you name it they got it. Still waiting on several call backs day 11 and counting...</p>
<p>Retro Fitness makes you feel hijacked when you try to cancel your membership. I tried for months to cancel going into the gym, and was told to email. Emailed and was told to call. Called and was told the manager would get back to me but never did. Contacted corporate and was told to send documentation. Sent the documentation and was sent to collection. I will stick to the higher paying clubs who are concerned with keeping clients happy!</p>
<p>The Personal Trainer, Mark is a salesman. That was what I had forgotten, when I was approached by Mark to try out a free personal trainer session. Thus, Little G (12 year old minor child) and I sat at the personal trainer desk with Mark as he typed on his computer to formalize an agreement regarding said services.</p>
<p>I joined Retro Fitness in Edison, NJ October 2012, and have been a faithful member until I received a personal email from the owner of this franchise Mitchell Kurtzer. The content of his email was revolved around water usage, yes "water"!! This owner does not allow you to refill your water bottles after your run out, but instead wants you to refill a small cup if and when you become thirsty. What does my membership cover???</p>
<p>DO NOT JOIN THIS GYM!!! If I could give them ZERO stars, I would. JOHN, the "manager" is the worst manager I've ever dealt with in my entire life. CATHERINE, the general manager, should really think about who she's hired and consider getting rid of him as soon as possible. Seriously. After trying to cancel my membership for 4 months, I can say that this is the worst gym that I've ever dealt with in my entire life. </p>
<p>My wife and I signed up for a year membership and personal training for 6 months. We never signed up for auto renewal! We signed up. They asked if we thought we may continue with the PT after the 6 months and I said no! The person that signed us up must have took the paperwork after we were through and checked the auto renewal box and now they are taking $150 a month out of my account each month on top of two monthly membership fees! I told them I want my money back and they said they can't refund my money when I haven't even finished with my first 6 months of PT yet! This is scam and they get paid on commission so will change your paperwork after you leave and tell you you signed it months later! This is so wrong and be careful if you use this terrible gym!</p>
<p>I signed up 4 years ago and stopped going later in the year. They informed me I had to continue to pay for the rest of the year due to contract. And that after that it wouldn't be continued. It has been 4 years and they refuse to stop billing. Finally my bank blocked the charges and now they are putting me in collections and trying to ruin my credit. I haven't been to a Retro in just about 4 years and they still won't let me cancel. They are trying to tell me it's a lifetime membership. This is crazy and as a disabled veteran who is working like crazy to take care of my sick wife I am about to lose it. These people are messing with the wrong person.</p>
<p>I ran into financial difficulties and could no longer afford my gym membership, I was sent a bill in the mail for $200 and was told this is my remaining balance. When walking into the gym I was told it would only cost me $19.99 monthly and that's all, with no contracts to sign or commitments like other area gyms I was also considering to join. The rep then told me to sit at a computer to enter my personal information. After doing that and entering my debit card information, I was then being charged $21 and change monthly for my membership and I was very happy with that. </p>
<p>I joined Retro for more than a year and things happen. I moved to another state in May where gym is kind of far from me. I strongly believed there is no contract and cancel anytime. In May I was told to send them 60 days notice. I needed to travel all the way from my new place to them (because other Retro fitness have no access to my profile) to bring official letter. Then, they told me that it is not acceptable, that I should mail them only certified letter and not to the main office, to the local one.  Back and forth it took another month. Ok, they received it on June 18. Ok, it's fine. I made 2 more months payments (because it takes "60 days to cancel!" Reallyyy??). But when I was told that cancellation will not be done until I pay in August for the next year maintenance, it is unacceptable.</p>
<p>I had signed a one year lease. Instead of the membership automatically canceling, they have a policy where you will have to send in a certified letter 90 days before. Or else the membership keeps going and you will be billed for the rest of your life if you don't send in a certified mail. This gym is a good gym. But I somehow believe this law was written to scam people. If I have signed one year lease it should be a one year lease. It shouldn't be more than that. This is a disgusting rule that a gym can put on the books. It's amazing. If you have options please join other gyms. It took me almost an additional 6 months to cancel my membership. Please look into this.</p>
<p>I just want to place my review about Bayonne Retro Fitness because I don't agree about this membership date. I enrolled last year on November/2014, paid in advance 39.00 plus 21.34 - Bayonne Retro Fitness the grand opening was in January/2015. Now August/2015 my payment of 21.34 monthly was declined and I found out that I am in debt of 41.00 for annuity. So, what's that? My year calendar has 12 months and in my agreement doesn't say nothing about annuity fee - in 8 months says annual fee only. I would like to least receive an email telling me about this early payment, the explanation was all members have to pay in August. Doesn't look good! Always something hiding and fishy in this Retro.</p>
<p>Retro Fitness in East Windsor, NJ sucks!!! Canceled my account back in June and they stick me with a $40 yearly fee for August. Then they tell me that I can't reverse the payment due to the fact that I would be considered delinquent.. Really? WTF?!?!? So then I look up Retro Fitness on Consumer Affairs website... 88 complaints. Well, now you can add one more to that list you stinkin' **. I will be anxiously waiting to see your gym go bankrupt...</p>
<p>I have emailed Retro Fitness three times through the "customer support form" and just tried leaving a message at the corporate office but all mailboxes are full. I also tried emailing the corporate office with the email address provided and, of course, it bounced back. I need to cancel my membership and would like to know the procedure. From all the reviews I've read online, everyone that has followed the procedure are still being billed and hassled.</p>
<p>My daughter went with a friend’s brother under 17 years old back in January 2015 to check the gym out. The sales person that signed them up advised my daughter that I needed to come. I come in with a blank check and sign a minor waiver. I went in. I asked the sales person the information. He specially said to me “This is the deal. No membership fee for signing up that day ("This is the last day"). No money down. $19.99 starts Feb. for the next 12 months.” What about if I want to cancel - He said "just notify us 30 days prior and you will no longer be auto deducted and you’re done. No charges." I said great. I asked for a copy and he said it was all in the computer. Well of course I never saw it. Never received one nor received an email of one. </p>
<p>I have 6 girlfriends that all joined the Cortlandt Manor Retro Fitness and pay $20 a month including classes. I went to join today and Alfonso is telling me it's $30 a month. I really wanted to join this gym for convenience, price and because of all the good things I've heard but not if they change their prices at whim.</p>
<p>The owner pammy, he is more concerned with selling fake designer sunglasses, Nike, under armor than running a gym. I thought I was at a flea market!!! Lol. Pammy the owner of retro he is a charter! Pammy you really should focus on the gym. Trust me you don't need to supplement your gym's income with selling fake merchandise! Gym is very capable of making a profit, if you run it like a gym instead of a flea market!!!</p>
<p>I cancelled my membership with Retro Fitness in East Meadow on April 21, in person, per the owner, with a letter. The owner told me they have a 60 day cancellation policy (I thought most gyms were 30 days). So I was debited in May and June. I see the charge again on July 7. I called, owner said she would remove it, hasn't yet removed it. I contacted my bank and cancelled the debit card and I am still fighting with my bank to have the July charge removed. I would never go to that gym again.</p>
<p>You had an advertisement that you would waive your initiation fee or processing fee one or the other so I went and they told me that there was still a $25 fee. The people had earlier told me that it was $20… I said is there any way they could waive it. They said no. I asked to speak to the manager. They told me to come back. I went back twice to do so. Finally when I met Sam, my experience couldn't have been any worse.</p>
<p>I called couples months ago and told them that I want to cancel. Whoever answer the phone told me that it is better to continue until the year end (June). He told me that I didn't need to go to the fitness center to cancel my membership. I called today Friday and this woman told me that I have to go. She was nasty.</p>
<p>Personal training department dangers, they sign you up for five training intervals and the form actually switched in front of you. Way down somewhere it says a whole year then when you try to quit it cost you hundreds to bail out. You need certified letters and still they don't reply back.</p>
<p>I have signed my son up for a Retro Fitness membership in December 2014. I was told he could cancel if need be but am having problem doing it. Since I attempted to cancel my charges have gone from 19.99 to 39.49.. I called and have not been able to speak to manager Amy directly in reference to why such high charges. I questioned extra charge and was told it's a fee cause my bank had insufficient funds. I have overdraft protection and it would not reject a request for payment. I also wanna note on days payment was requested I had sufficient funds in my checking account. I think this is unfair charging and am looking to get a refund of overcharges. Thank you for your time and assistance.</p>
<p>The male manager at Retro Farmingdale treated me rudely. Was passive aggressive by snarling, ignoring, and turning his back on me. I yelled at him and appeared as the aggressor. Asked for his manager and was ignored again. Had to ask three times. Called Debra ** and was told the employee was sterling. Was humiliated and abused.</p>
<p>Watch Out! These SCAMS ARTISTS did two different contracts for me and my husband. When I cancel my contract without problems, but my husband who works and gets 70% outside the city can not cancel his contract. Hopefully, we froze the contract, returned it, explain his situation without no solution. There is no sense to be a member of a GYM without reside and stay only paying indefinitely. I cancel this blood sucks. Now they send our name to bad credit, after all attempts to amicable cancel this contract that we pay and never use.</p>
<p>Beware of this gym. They are all nice and friendly when you sign up. When you try to cancel they make you go through a process that is just ridiculous. They make you send them a certified letter asking to cancel and then they have the nerve to tell you that it takes 60 days to cancel. 60 days? The year is 2015 not 1945. They obviously have no regard for their customers' time. Also, try calling their headquarters at 732 431 0062. Nobody ever picks up the phone. Some people have full mailboxes and you cannot even leave a message. CROOKED and UNETHICAL jerks.</p>
<p>Went there on the 14th of May to check the gym facilities and got signed up to try Zumba class on the following Monday. Show up on Monday to benefit of the free class and the receptionist tells me my pass has expired. They have set it up to start on the 11th, which I was not ever there, and end it on the day I was supposed to start the class. It clearly was a mistake but the girl never even try to accommodate me with a good customer service. No alternative solution was provided but empty words. The trainer who could prove my story was on the phone for the longest time (also not really available on the day I visit the first time). I left. Definitely never will sign up for such a poor customer service fitness providers.</p>
<p>Please be wary if you join this gym. I joined the East Meadow, NY location. After 12 months, I cancelled my account in January. I was then told I had a free month and it would be cancelled after that. It's May and I'm still being charged. After calling to complain to the manager she states that there's a 60 day cancellation process, and that February and March don't count because they were free. First of all, I was told I only had one month free. Second, why wouldn't the free month count as part of the 60 days? Third, NO ONE told me about this 60 days BS when I signed up. I saw the awful reviews online and should have listened. I've now been unfairly sucked out of at least 40 dollars (and that's if I get a refund for May). I honestly try to be fair, but these are just awful business practices. I even have a Retro close to where I live now, but I'd rather drive further out than sign up there.</p>
<p>I entered into a contract for personal training with Profession Fitness who operates inside the Retro Fitness facility in Bordentown, however I cancelled that contract within the 72 hour window stated in the contract details. I have proof of the cancellation letter sent by certified mail with a return receipt. In the contract it states that if the contract is cancelled within the 72 hour allotted time frame, I am entitled to a full refund by the health club within 30 days. It has been more than 30 days and I have not received my refund. I have called the club on two occasions and the issue has not been resolved. I am owed a $599 refund.</p>
[<p>Just joined Retro Neptune City. Paid for a full year. Paid for 24 strength training sessions. After one session was unable to access computer program (after multiple attempts) to set up future sessions. Advised facility of difficulty. Advised by employee, "Nothing has changed since you signed up." After the one training session I was advised by the trainer that he "would text" to set up the next session. Never heard from him. </p>, <p>I was a member of Retro Fitness in Flemington NJ for 3 years. It was a good experience until I tried to cancel my membership. I was told that it takes 60 days (2 months) to process the cancellation, during which time I would continue to be charged. I could still use the gym during that time, though... My question is: Why is it that when you join Retro Fitness your paperwork is processed immediately, however, it takes 2 months when you cancel??? Planet Fitness processes your cancellation immediately. Poor business practice Retro Fitness! If you treat your customers fairly, they may return.</p>, <p>I enrolled at Retro Fitness with my husband and 15 yr old son, thinking it was a nice place since it had opened not long ago. The first day we went to the gym was very disappointing. There wasn't machines like at Planet Fitness, and I felt violated, perverts just eyeing you made it very uncomfortable. I told my husband and we decided it was not a place for us. My husband went to cancel and was told No unless you have a medical condition. I fully understand the policy however, if we decided not to go they can charge some early cancelation fee and not force us to keep a contract for a whole yr charging the card. </p>, <p>The whole home gym crap is ridiculous. If I'm able to use any facility I should be able to pay my dues at any facility instead of being sent to a different city or state to do so. All payments are handled by ABC financial anyway. There is no actual way to get any customer service complaint resolved... At the Belleville NJ Retro, the staff refused to get a manager or provide contact info to reach him myself. This gym in particular is the biggest offender. I've had more issues before even starting my work out than here than any other. Poor customer service, severe lack of knowledge, nasty attitudes, you name it they got it. Still waiting on several call backs day 11 and counting...</p>, <p>Retro Fitness makes you feel hijacked when you try to cancel your membership. I tried for months to cancel going into the gym, and was told to email. Emailed and was told to call. Called and was told the manager would get back to me but never did. Contacted corporate and was told to send documentation. Sent the documentation and was sent to collection. I will stick to the higher paying clubs who are concerned with keeping clients happy!</p>, <p>The Personal Trainer, Mark is a salesman. That was what I had forgotten, when I was approached by Mark to try out a free personal trainer session. Thus, Little G (12 year old minor child) and I sat at the personal trainer desk with Mark as he typed on his computer to formalize an agreement regarding said services.</p>, <p>I joined Retro Fitness in Edison, NJ October 2012, and have been a faithful member until I received a personal email from the owner of this franchise Mitchell Kurtzer. The content of his email was revolved around water usage, yes "water"!! This owner does not allow you to refill your water bottles after your run out, but instead wants you to refill a small cup if and when you become thirsty. What does my membership cover???</p>, <p>DO NOT JOIN THIS GYM!!! If I could give them ZERO stars, I would. JOHN, the "manager" is the worst manager I've ever dealt with in my entire life. CATHERINE, the general manager, should really think about who she's hired and consider getting rid of him as soon as possible. Seriously. After trying to cancel my membership for 4 months, I can say that this is the worst gym that I've ever dealt with in my entire life. </p>, <p>My wife and I signed up for a year membership and personal training for 6 months. We never signed up for auto renewal! We signed up. They asked if we thought we may continue with the PT after the 6 months and I said no! The person that signed us up must have took the paperwork after we were through and checked the auto renewal box and now they are taking $150 a month out of my account each month on top of two monthly membership fees! I told them I want my money back and they said they can't refund my money when I haven't even finished with my first 6 months of PT yet! This is scam and they get paid on commission so will change your paperwork after you leave and tell you you signed it months later! This is so wrong and be careful if you use this terrible gym!</p>, <p>I signed up 4 years ago and stopped going later in the year. They informed me I had to continue to pay for the rest of the year due to contract. And that after that it wouldn't be continued. It has been 4 years and they refuse to stop billing. Finally my bank blocked the charges and now they are putting me in collections and trying to ruin my credit. I haven't been to a Retro in just about 4 years and they still won't let me cancel. They are trying to tell me it's a lifetime membership. This is crazy and as a disabled veteran who is working like crazy to take care of my sick wife I am about to lose it. These people are messing with the wrong person.</p>, <p>I ran into financial difficulties and could no longer afford my gym membership, I was sent a bill in the mail for $200 and was told this is my remaining balance. When walking into the gym I was told it would only cost me $19.99 monthly and that's all, with no contracts to sign or commitments like other area gyms I was also considering to join. The rep then told me to sit at a computer to enter my personal information. After doing that and entering my debit card information, I was then being charged $21 and change monthly for my membership and I was very happy with that. </p>, <p>I joined Retro for more than a year and things happen. I moved to another state in May where gym is kind of far from me. I strongly believed there is no contract and cancel anytime. In May I was told to send them 60 days notice. I needed to travel all the way from my new place to them (because other Retro fitness have no access to my profile) to bring official letter. Then, they told me that it is not acceptable, that I should mail them only certified letter and not to the main office, to the local one.  Back and forth it took another month. Ok, they received it on June 18. Ok, it's fine. I made 2 more months payments (because it takes "60 days to cancel!" Reallyyy??). But when I was told that cancellation will not be done until I pay in August for the next year maintenance, it is unacceptable.</p>, <p>I had signed a one year lease. Instead of the membership automatically canceling, they have a policy where you will have to send in a certified letter 90 days before. Or else the membership keeps going and you will be billed for the rest of your life if you don't send in a certified mail. This gym is a good gym. But I somehow believe this law was written to scam people. If I have signed one year lease it should be a one year lease. It shouldn't be more than that. This is a disgusting rule that a gym can put on the books. It's amazing. If you have options please join other gyms. It took me almost an additional 6 months to cancel my membership. Please look into this.</p>, <p>I just want to place my review about Bayonne Retro Fitness because I don't agree about this membership date.

<p>Retro's are poorly managed and have very low standards. I would recommend not joining this gym unless you can tolerate a tacky atmosphere of loud obnoxious music, and members. Save your 20.00 and do something else to stay in shape.</p>
<p>Customer service is a very low (non existent) priority of **, the woman who owns this gym. Recently, over a period of many days some equipment was malfunctioning and staff didn't know when repairs would be made. For a number of days I asked that the owner please contact me. She never responded. On Sunday April 5th she was at the gym but avoided me. I asked why I never heard from her. Her response was if I'm dissatisfied she will cancel my membership; and that I should "get the hell out of there immediately; and that if I didn't she would call the police." I told her "yes, please cancel the membership and let me have a receipt confirming cancellation." Again, I was told to get the hell out of there or she would call the police. Any requests for information about this gym from others will definitely be met with "Do not join!"</p>
<p>I feel that Retro Fitness is not a fair company. I brought my son in who is 16 YRS, never seen a sign saying that if under 18 he could not come as a guest. However I have been noticing other people bring their child in who looks to be under than age of 11 and he works out all the time. I will say that I am not sure if he has a membership but no child can sign a contract so I question that situation. I am wondering how to get out of this contract because of some unfair things I have seen happen in the location I attend which is the one on McDade Blvd PA. I would like to go back to Planet Fitness where my child is allowed to come with me as a guest with no questions asked and where they treat everyone fair no matter what COLOR you are.</p>
<p>What would an 82 year old woman whose husband recently passed away really do to warrant being asked to leave after over 5 years a member... mention to management that she was going to let corporate know of the equipment not working and it not being fixed. With that one complaint she was asked to leave and had her membership refunded. When I tried to contact management as to why no warnings, I received no response. Corporate heads should follow up to ensure that the local independently owned gyms are being held to the corporate standard that was originally set when the company was opened. I am very disappointed.</p>
<p>Overall, as a customer I am satisfied with every aspect of the gym. My only issue is I have a schedule every morning. I wake up at 430am to be there by 5am to get an hour's work out daily and every morning the employees no less than 5 to 10 minutes late. For instance today 3/16/2015 he/she is 30 minutes late which is unacceptable. So I left and could not work out and my scheduled work out was ruined.</p>
<p>Me and my fiance had this gym for about a year. We were moving to fl so we called to see how we cancel. Told us have to be certified letter, 30 days cancel notice. We did exactly that and guess what, now there is a 132$ acct from them in collections on my credit.</p>
<p>My husband has been a member for over a year and I have been a member for a year. During that time, the gym has consistently gone downhill. They continue to give free memberships to new customers while treating the existing members like pond scum. The gym is getting ridiculously crowded and they never fix the equipment. The ladies' room is a mess. I have read other comments and it scares the hell out of me since it is obvious that you can't cancel your membership. The staff, with few exceptions, are con artists. Is there anything that can be done about this?</p>
<p>My credit card is on file with Retro Fitness because they take our monthly gym dues out which I gave them permission by signing their contract. After being members for close to 3 years my son was approached by one of the personal trainers about this supposedly great deal where he would have a personal trainer and it would only cost about 30$ a month and he could cancel anytime. So my son, even though he was 21 at the time was very gullible and trusting so he signed the contract. When he came home and told me about it I told him to go back and cancel it. </p>
<p>Received an advertisement from Retro Fitness, 11 Park Place, Paramus, New Jersey, advertising two choices of membership: 1. A year membership with $0 enrollment paying a processing fee of $21.39 and recurring monthly charge of 21.39 (with tax included) OR 2. A no contract membership paying $53.49 up front and recurring $21.39 per month (with tax included) with the stipulation you can drop out whenever you would like, but you lose the $53.49. The advertisement DOES NOT mention the charge of a fee of $41.73 in August for BOTH of these plans. If you visit the gym to sign up, you will not be told; if you sign up online, it is not apparent. YOU MUST READ THE TERMS CAREFULLY as I did before joining.</p>
<p>I just complained to BBB. I have also complained with all the Retro Fitness managers (Anthony, Adam, Betsy), and Retro Fitness Corporate (John Michael from customer services) with no effect. The gym is clean but avoid their personal training services. If you have problems with it, they won't help you resolve it. Once you sign a 12 month contract you are stuck. They have lied to me, not honored their word, provided the worst customer service I have ever experienced and implied I am lying. They have been unprofessional by not keeping scheduled appointments.</p>
<p>I signed up for the gym before it opened. At that time they told me all classes were think we did. Now they want to charge me for all classes. Bad service. They don't fix the equipment. They don't have a separate area for exercise. And I cannot get in touch with corporate office.</p>
<p>My boyfriend has been trying to cancel his gym membership for longer than I care to recall. There is nothing you can do over the phone, except leave a message for someone to call you back. When they do, they tell you that you have to: Put your request in writing; Send the letter to them via certified mail; and Pay 2 months membership fee as a penalty. With that, we thought we would skip a step and go to the gym with the signed letter requesting to cancel. Would you believe that the manager refused to accept it??? It must be sent via certified mail...(Did I mention his contract was up 2 years ago?...)</p>
<p>I joined the club on 1/27/15 but I was waiting for a job that I applied. The job came through on Wednesday 1/29/15 just 2 days after joining. I told them my job is 2 hours away from my home state, and I have the need to stay here and visit my state only on weekends. I need that time to spend with my kids. I try to cancel the contract but nobody help me. Also at front nobody tell you that you will be charge 40 dollars after 6 months using the gym, beside the 20 dollars of monthly fee. They are fake. I hope that all of them end up in jail.</p>
<p>I walked into Retro Fitness in Neptune NJ with my sister-in-law. A girl at the counter told me that she would help me with a 7-day trial period with no membership needed, that she would need two forms of ID and to pay for the trial. I paid for the trial on the account that the attendant behind the counter stated that Retro would not take money out of my account without my consent. </p>
<p>After not using the gym for many months, I visited their Commack facility on May 5th 2014 to cancel. I was leaving for Europe for 6 weeks and decide to cancel my membership after being a member for about a three years. I was told that here would be a two month penalty according to their agreement which agreed to and that they will bill me for an additional two month. I walked away and was never asked to sign or do anything more. After I returned from EU I noticed that they were still taking money from my account. I then visited the Dear Park facility and asked why I was still getting charged and was told that I would have to discuss this with the Commack facility since all my records were supposedly there. </p>
<p>The staff Alexa and John and the owner are all crook, on paid membership they were so rude and arrogant. The owner is started to show his muscles and then misbehave when ask for membership rights. Machines not working, tv not working, bad very bad and worse attitude. Be careful while joining this gym, we still have to see how to get our refund while on the first day the behavior was so arrogant and nasty. We would advise all not to join this and be careful as you won't get anything for what you paid for.</p>
<p>I originally signed up at a brand new Retro Fitness in Forked River, NJ. I signed up so I could get free classes for a year, it was a promotion. The building was still not ready but they had a little office set up. I just moved back to NJ from OR where I didn't have such problems as I do in NJ (NJ is a joke, don't live there if you don't have to). Anyway, I had to transfer my membership to Toms River on rt 37. I never took any classes at the Lacey Retro because they were not open yet, but I had a situation where I had to move kinda fast. So, Toms River and Lacey tell me in order to transfer my membership I have to check in 13 days out of the month. I checked it day after day after day after day and I would ask occasionally, "Did my membership change over?" "Not yet, not yet, not yet." </p>
<p>My two sons (22 &amp; 16 y/o) signed up and paid upfront (they thought that what they paid was for the annual dues, but wasn't), it was just for the membership! They found out later that they need to pay every month for the monthly dues! Told them right away that they need to cancel that because they don't have money for that and just went for two months (July &amp; August, summer '13) and haven't got back because they got back to school! The bills kept coming and I even called them. They said my sons need to go there personally to cancel it! But when they went there they just showed them that they electronically signed-up for it and need to stay for one year and pay for the dues! My son who was 16 (whose a minor) even I told him that I'm not paying for it, settled the account but my other son just requested to hold his membership because he can't afford it! Now, there's this collection agency calling him everyday about this matter! </p>
<p>I canceled my account in December 2013. They told me I had to do this in writing which I did and dropped off in person. They then told me I was liable for the contract until August of 2014. What happened to being able to cancel at any time. Now I receive in the mail a payment booklet showing I owe through August of 2015. I called again and spoke to the rudest girl (Amanda) who is a manager at this site. She informs me they do not have a written cancellation on file. I also explained if she looks at my attendance records I have never even been there because I canceled. They apparently give false information on cancellation at any time. Do not keep good records, and are extremely rude. Don't become a member of Retro. They are terrible.</p>
<p>I never got any assistance. When I asked for help they said I needed an appointment. I made 2 appointments. One man was on the phone for half an hour. I left. The other never showed for work. I had no idea what to use.. I'm 79 yrs old. The bikes were hard to get on. Some machines didn't work. I had to ask other people what they were doing and why. I tried my best but often went home hurting... They told me I couldn't cancel unless I moved over 25 miles away or had a doctor's note. My doctor wrote a note but I haven't heard from them.</p>
<p>Dirty. They sent the contract by email after we had paid and signed through electronics. They did not tell us there is a hefty cancellation fee. We would not have joined. Below, they stipulated that THAT THEIR CLIENTS CANNOT CANCEL. (Is that legal?). "You understand that, except as herein provided, your membership is absolutely non-cancellable..."</p>
<p>My husband and I unfortunately signed a contract with Retro Fitness back in April. A month later, my husband lost his job. We went to our Retro location to explain the story of why we had to cancel and they outright said no! We were told when we signed the contract that canceling would not be an issue and now because we had no income and needed to cancel we are told no way. They said they would put our membership in a freeze status. Fast forward a few months later and now our contracts are with collections. We are being harassed by a collection agency with people who can barely speak English telling us we have to pay for the life of the contracts! This is harassment. Can you help? We are willing to pay for the three to four months do missed payments but not thousands of dollars that I don't have. This Deborah collector was beyond nasty, demanding money and not wanting to send anything in writing.</p>
<p>Deer park - Employees are good but the owner could care less about the gym. The equipment is old and not maintained, the rubber grips are never replaced on any of it. The water fountain barely works and slowly spills out warm water, it's been that way for two years, the bathroom sinks don't work.. The place is a mess.</p>
<p>They keep taking $350 out of my acct when I told Johnathan 2 months ago to cancel. They didn't cancel it, now I'm backed up in bills. I also have high blood pressure and I really wasn't supposed to be working with a trainer. I worked out twice only with a trainer and almost fell out after the workout. I called to speak to them and they are giving me the runaround. I can sue them, because they know I have high blood pressure. I stated it on the application. The worst.</p>
<p>I cancelled my son's account on May 13, 2014. They told me I need to pay for the next two months so I transferred his account to my name. At the end of July, I should have been done. So I thought, and on August 1, 2014 they charge me $29.00 for an annual fee and I call and the response I got was that everyone gets charged. Well that's fine if everyone did not cancel. She told me I need to call the billing company and discuss it with them. I informed her that's not my job and I don't get paid to do her job. I left a message for a manager to call back, but because it was a weekend, apparently they have no managers on until Monday. I waited and did not receive a call back. </p>
<p>Have called countless times and I haven't been able to cancel my contract after which I refuse to pay anymore and put a stop on my bank account. Now they are calling me because I owe them money. This Gym is Horrible and the way the staff treats you is unbelievable.</p>
<p>I called to cancel my membership and they said that they needed a letter. So I said I would be right there. And that's when I was told it would take 2 months for it to be processed and that I would still have to pay and that it's in their contract that I signed. Why and how would one know 60 days in advance that they would need to cancel? Oh but you can't use the gym during those 2 months that it's being processed. Mmmm.</p>
<p>I've been trying to cancel my membership. I've called numerous times at one point they told me I needed to wait til the manager was in, so callback. I called back and then I was told to come in to cancel and then when I finally go to cancel they tell me I need to send a certified letter to them. And the manager had to have been all of 18 years old and didn't know much about anything. They are complete scam artists and the girl just kept telling me I signed a contract. I was in this contract for well over a year and now I wasn't out. This needs to be investigated and something needs to be done, I see I'm not the only one with this problem.</p>
<p>What a fraud. I am trying to cancel my contract. No one ever said you couldn't cancel and give 30 days notice. They make it impossible to get out. Don't sign anything!!!</p>
<p>The gym facility is horrible. It's too crowded. The stretching space has boxing equipment in the same area so when you're over there, you're likely gonna encounter somebody banging on the boxing equipment which is really, really loud. The General Manager has the worst attitude, which I found out wasn't unique to me. I asked some of the other members and they all had the same experience.</p>
[<p>Retro's are poorly managed and have very low standards. I would recommend not joining this gym unless you can tolerate a tacky atmosphere of loud obnoxious music, and members. Save your 20.00 and do something else to stay in shape.</p>, <p>Customer service is a very low (non existent) priority of **, the woman who owns this gym. Recently, over a period of many days some equipment was malfunctioning and staff didn't know when repairs would be made. For a number of days I asked that the owner please contact me. She never responded. On Sunday April 5th she was at the gym but avoided me. I asked why I never heard from her. Her response was if I'm dissatisfied she will cancel my membership; and that I should "get the hell out of there immediately; and that if I didn't she would call the police." I told her "yes, please cancel the membership and let me have a receipt confirming cancellation." Again, I was told to get the hell out of there or she would call the police. Any requests for information about this gym from others will definitely be met with "Do not join!"</p>, <p>I feel that Retro Fitness is not a fair company. I brought my son in who is 16 YRS, never seen a sign saying that if under 18 he could not come as a guest. However I have been noticing other people bring their child in who looks to be under than age of 11 and he works out all the time. I will say that I am not sure if he has a membership but no child can sign a contract so I question that situation. I am wondering how to get out of this contract because of some unfair things I have seen happen in the location I attend which is the one on McDade Blvd PA. I would like to go back to Planet Fitness where my child is allowed to come with me as a guest with no questions asked and where they treat everyone fair no matter what COLOR you are.</p>, <p>What would an 82 year old woman whose husband recently passed away really do to warrant being asked to leave after over 5 years a member... mention to management that she was going to let corporate know of the equipment not working and it not being fixed. With that one complaint she was asked to leave and had her membership refunded. When I tried to contact management as to why no warnings, I received no response. Corporate heads should follow up to ensure that the local independently owned gyms are being held to the corporate standard that was originally set when the company was opened. I am very disappointed.</p>, <p>Overall, as a customer I am satisfied with every aspect of the gym. My only issue is I have a schedule every morning. I wake up at 430am to be there by 5am to get an hour's work out daily and every morning the employees no less than 5 to 10 minutes late. For instance today 3/16/2015 he/she is 30 minutes late which is unacceptable. So I left and could not work out and my scheduled work out was ruined.</p>, <p>Me and my fiance had this gym for about a year. We were moving to fl so we called to see how we cancel. Told us have to be certified letter, 30 days cancel notice. We did exactly that and guess what, now there is a 132$ acct from them in collections on my credit.</p>, <p>My husband has been a member for over a year and I have been a member for a year. During that time, the gym has consistently gone downhill. They continue to give free memberships to new customers while treating the existing members like pond scum. The gym is getting ridiculously crowded and they never fix the equipment. The ladies' room is a mess. I have read other comments and it scares the hell out of me since it is obvious that you can't cancel your membership. The staff, with few exceptions, are con artists. Is there anything that can be done about this?</p>, <p>My credit card is on file with Retro Fitness because they take our monthly gym dues out which I gave them permission by signing their contract. After being members for close to 3 years my son was approached by one of the personal trainers about this supposedly great deal where he would have a personal trainer and it would only cost about 30$ a month and he could cancel anytime. So my son, even though he was 21 at the time was very gullible and trusting so he signed the contract. When he came home and told me about it I told him to go back and cancel it. </p>, <p>Received an advertisement from Retro Fitness, 11 Park Place, Paramus, New Jersey, advertising two choices of membership: 1. A year membership with $0 enrollment paying a processing fee of $21.39 and recurring monthly charge of 21.39 (with tax included) OR 2. A no contract membership paying $53.49 up front and recurring $21.39 per month (with tax included) with the stipulation you can drop out whenever you would like, but you lose the $53.49. The advertisement DOES NOT mention the charge of a fee of $41.73 in August for BOTH of these plans. If you visit the gym to sign up, you will not be told; if you sign up online, it is not apparent. YOU MUST READ THE TERMS CAREFULLY as I did before joining.</p>, <p>I just complained to BBB. I have also complained with all the Retro Fitness managers (Anthony, Adam, Betsy), and Retro Fitness Corporate (John Michael from customer services) with no effect. The gym is clean but avoid their personal training services. If you have problems with it, they won't help you resolve it. Once you sign a 12 month contract you are stuck. They have lied to me, not honored their word, provided the worst customer service I have ever experienced and implied I am lying. They have been unprofessional by not keeping scheduled appointments.</p>, <p>I signed up for the gym before it opened. At that time they told me all classes were think we did. Now they want to charge me for all classes. Bad service. They don't fix the equipment. They don't have a separate area for exercise. And I cannot get in touch with corporate office.</p>, <p>My boyfriend has been trying to cancel his gym membership for longer than I care to recall. There is nothing you can do over the phone, except leave a message for someone to call you back. When they do, they tell you that you have to: Put your request in writing; Send the letter to them via certified mail; and Pay 2 months membership fee as a penalty. With that, we thought we would skip a step and go to the gym with the signed letter requesting to cancel. Would you believe that the manager refused to accept it??? It must be sent via certified mail...(Did I mention his contract was up 2 years ago?...)</p>, <p>I joined the club on 1/27/15 but I was waiting for a job that I applied. The job came through on Wednesday 1/29/15 just 2 days after joining. I told them my job is 2 hours away from my home state, and I have the need to stay here and visit my state only on weekends. I need that time to spend with my kids. I try to cancel the contract but nobody help me. Also at front nobody tell you that you will be charge 40 dollars after 6 months using the gym, beside the 20 dollars of monthly fee. They are fake. I hope that all of them end up in jail.</p>, <p>I walked into Retro Fitness in Neptune NJ with my sister-in-law.

<p>For the price of the gym membership it's worth it. I specify 'gym' because they will try to convince you to sign up for personal training once you become a member and when you ask questions such as "Is this a monthly cost or am I only paying for eight sessions to try out the trainer without any obligation" and the manager says, "that's right you're only signing up for eight sessions and you're not bound to a contract." We just want you to sign this pad that allows us to use the same credit card on file. BEWARE! They lie to get you to sign a pad that doesn't state anything of the sort and when you find out after the fact, the eight sessions you initially thought you signed up for is really a down payment for a twelve month contract totaling $1,755.60. I asked for a refund and they pass it off to the next guy on duty. They still have not resolved the issue and it's been over two months now. Very disappointed.</p>
<p>I met with the fitness manager Tyrees to inquire about personal training sessions. At that time I was interested in obtaining personal training sessions for a month or two to kick start my plan to lose weight and get in shape. The fitness manager, Tyrees, spent about 40 minutes convincing me that if I sign up for a year program and pay the full amount of money cash in advance I will have a full comprehensive program. The full comprehensive program according to Tyrees will include: 1) a monthly progress evaluation with him personally 2) bimonthly body measurements 3) Diet evaluation and advice by my personal trainer 4) a monthly meeting with certified dietitian 5) a customized workout adjusted to my progress and ability.</p>
<p>My daughter joined Retro Fitness and we signed up for a personal trainer just so she knows what to do and how to do it correctly. We only wanted the personal trainer for 2 months, and now they are taking $210.00 out of my bank acct every month, plus $40.00 for her monthly membership fees which are only supposed to be $20.00 a month. We wrote a letter expressing we no longer need the personal trainer and she is going to give up her membership and that was 4 months ago. I am furious with these people. I call and they tell me it is a automatic renewal and I explained everything to the person on the phone we don't want the membership anymore, but come the following month, they do it again - take my money. THEY ARE RIP OFF ARTISTS.</p>
<p>I signed up with EFT at Retro. The training program was inconsistent and the trainers never follow a program or weight guide. My chart was never accurate and was filled out randomly by a trainer for training he never performed!!! After a month or so of training, I started to Feel lower back pain that transform to radiation pain to my leg. I asked to stop my training till I get treatment. I was diagnosed with herniated disk in lower back and went trough extensive physical therapy and medication. To my surprise EFT claim its really not their problem since they are covered by my liability release. In addition they send their collection agency and placed derogatory claim on my credit report for $4550!!! Needless to say that the contract was not even half of this amount!!!! Yes I agree a class action need to be taken against them!!!!</p>
<p>This gym is a master at this particular scam. When you try to cancel, they will IGNORE the letter or whatever way you cancelled. You will still continue to get billed. They will send you to collections. And they are INSANELY RUDE on the phone. I am still trying to get out of a membership. I canceled 5 MONTHS AGO!!!!</p>
<p>I had signed a 1-year contract with Retro Fitness in Deer Park, NY. My final payment under that contract was supposed to be January 19, 2014. I purposely DID NOT elect for auto renewal because of the complicated terms to cancel it. I left that part not initialed. I come to find out I had been charged for February, March, and now April. I went in to see what the deal was and they showed me a scanned image of my contract with the auto renewal initialed. My copy clearly shows it was left blank. Someone initialed it after I left!!!</p>
<p>I went in for advice on personal training, asked for one month. However, received a 12-month package. I made three appts. Each time the trainer never ever showed. Tried to cancel; however, I was told by EFT that I had three days. That's it. The person running the program called me stating he will lower the price for me. That was two days ago; still no response. The gym is beautiful. People are friendly. The training personnel are horrible. I am so upset. Something needs to be done at once.</p>
<p>Was charged an enrollment processing and maintenance fee (totaling almost $54.00) and was not told all this.</p>
<p>My situation is similar to other complaints that I've read. I cancelled my membership because of medical issues but I did complete my year membership so that I was not charged the penalty for cancelling early. I had fully planned on going back once my arm and shoulder were healed but in the meantime, my wallet was stolen with all of my credit cards in it so I cancelled my cards. Because they could not charge my card, I am being harassed by the company that bills for them. I had already met my year commitment so I do not understand why they didn't just cancel when I requested. I called the NE Philadelphia location and was instructed to email **, the General Manager, and he would take care of it. I have not had one response from **. In my email, I told them the card that they would try to charge was not valid and explained the situation. I will never go back now and will try to warn everyone that will listen what a ripoff this company is!! Go to LA Fitness. It costs more but is well worth it!</p>
<p>I signed up to Retro Fitness a few years back, in the beginning I was going quite regularly, after a while I stopped going, but I didn't plan on canceling my membership as I was planning to start going again, then for some reason there was a problem with my credit card and the charge did not go through (that was well after a year of membership) so instead of canceling my membership, they continue to try charge my card and add a penalty charge, and then send it to collection. I think this is a total ripoff strategy by Retro Fitness, that's totally unheard of, every other company with such kind membership would just simple cancel your membership. I think a CLASS ACTION needs to be filed against them.</p>
<p>This company is just a spam, they're not here to provide you service so are here to steal your money and to fool you in their contract. In tiny small letters you agree to auto renew your membership for a year unless you send a certified letter 90 days before your membership ends.</p>
<p>I joined Retro Fitness in Easton, PA in July of 2011 and made my first attempt to cancel the membership in July 2012. I specifically waited until that time because of the one year commitment, not mentioned by the person at the gym, but hidden in the contract. I did this by calling the 800 number I was given at the local gym. Debits of my bank account continued and I called again in August of 2012. Still debits continued so I went to the location in person but again was told to call the 800 number. This time, late August, I sent written request to the only address I could find, that of the local gym.</p>
<p>I joined Retro Fitness in January 2013. My contract has a very clear Expiration Date of January 30, 2014. So why today March 1, 2014 they are still charging my account? I called Retro Fitness in Manhawkin, NJ where I signed up. The girl on the phone told me I have to send a Certified Letter! to the Manahakin Retro Fitness so they can cancel. I asked to speak to a manager and guess what he is not there until Monday after 3pm? (Today is Saturday) I never received a phone call, email or Letter notifying me that they will automatic continue my contract and continue to charge my account. I called my bank and I am disputing the charges from them. This contract is Misleading and a Contract Of Entrapment. I will be sending out the certified letter. I hope this will resolve this issue as I have been reading all other complaints here. I will never sign up with them.</p>
<p>I went to the gym. They wrote down all the information to cancel and they told me THAT I CANCELLED. I asked them for a receipt, But they say it was not necessary. That was in August, and I still get a charge on my credit card. I think we need to get a class action lawsuit against them because there are way too many people in this boat.</p>
<p>I have been dealing with trying to cancel my membership since 9/21/13 but the owner never cancelled the membership. Worst yet, she never returned my phone calls until mid December. I went in person to resolve this issue, the owner Christina told me I still owed money. I asked her to explain why it took her three months to return my 5 phone calls. "You should have read your contract," it sounded like speaking to a robot. She is not listening, I have never heard of a ridiculous policy like this. I always paid my dues a month ahead, and she purposely didn't cancel the membership to squeeze more money out of me. </p>
<p>I have been trying to cancel my membership with Retro Fitness in Middletown since September 2013. A friend of mine is a personal trainer and had given me a workout to do. I had asked one of the guys where a certain machine was. He was at the counter reading a newspaper as if he couldn't be bothered. Upon seeing my notebook with my workout, he began to drill me about where I got my workout, who my friend was, where she trained, he was so rude. I tried to cancel my membership and was told you had to cancel in Manahawkin because my membership had been transferred there. The Middletown manager tried to say I was close to $300 behind on payments. </p>
<p>Retro let me sign up at the gym but when I asked about canceling my membership I was referred to a phone number. At this number I was on hold over 30 mins and had to drop off to get back to work on two occasions. When I finally got through to someone they of course had to transfer me to a specialist whose only specialties seemed to be refusing to acknowledge my request, dragging the conversation on as long as possible, and trying to talk me into not canceling. In the end a change of my CC number was the only thing that stopped the charges. Retro Fitness is a terrible company to deal with. Join at your own risk.</p>
<p>Please beware of Retro Fitness Astoria. If you JOIN, please be prepared to JOIN FOR LIFE. They will make quitting more of a workout than you ever had at the GYM. I joined August 2012 and after ONE year decided that I'd cancel the membership. In September 2013, I went ONLINE and submitted the cancellation as instructed. I received an email indicating that a member of the Retro Staff would contact me. I assumed they'd call to try and discourage me from quitting. I never received that call, but in good faith I assumed my membership had been cancelled. Another month, another charge. </p>
<p>On 11/13/2013 I was trained by Kyle at the Brick NJ location as part of the "FREE" fitness evaluation. At that time I agreed to sign up for weekly training. 2 days later I was contacted by a trainer at the facility who informed me he did not work on Saturdays. The following day Kyle said he would have someone that did work on weekends call me. On November 16th I received a text message from "Robb" to set up a training session. He informed me that day he would get back to me "early the following week" to set up the appointment. He did not reach out to me "early the next week."</p>
<p>I cancelled my membership 2 years ago. I went into the gym and signed a cancellation form. They never ended up canceling my membership and basically stole from me for 2 years. I should be paid back. To boot the owner is never there to speak to whenever there is an issue!</p>
<p>On 3/11, my mother and myself joined the Retro Fitness gym - 2571 Hempstead Tpke, East Meadow. After leaving, we both agreed we didn't like the atmosphere so we went to a different gym and joined there. The SAME night, we went back to Retro Fitness and told the SAME person who signed us up that we decided that gym wasn't for us. She ripped up our contracts and took our key chain scan passes. She told us that was it. I continued getting emails from them the days following so I called to make sure it was cancelled and was told "My sister and I run it. It was taken care of." </p>
<p>I cancel my account in Feb. 2013. They ask for a doctor's note that I gave and they still charge my credit card so I'm forced to sue them for my money.</p>
<p>Two sons joined well over a year ago, almost two years now. One son moved. He called to cancel, still being charged on his credit card. Sent a certified letter to East Meadow and home office in NJ to demand cancellation. Other son, being charged $29.00 and $19.99 for the month of August! Called them in East Meadow, they said have to come in person. What the hell?? Never heard of such crap in my life! Want the memberships cancelled! What a waste of $! Never would recommend this place EVER!</p>
<p>Worst gym I have EVER been to. Front desk was rude. 8 treadmills had OUT OF ORDER SIGN. I was told by another member the one I got on was broken and was waiting for a sign (and it was broken, I stayed 1 1/2 hours "trying" to get a good session in. When I left the treadmill still had no sign). Gym set up is tight and leaves no room to breathe. All the equipment is on top of the next. The bathroom was FILTHY. I could not find towelettes to wipe the equipment down (no one in the gym had the courtesy of wiping the equipment off after use I noticed). The weights were ALL over the floor and there were no handles on the machines to use the machines (I looked for 15 minutes for a handle, went to the desk to ask and was told they were "around" or being used. Not enough handles for the equipment they have?).</p>
<p>Good marketing strategy, $19.99, but you end up in paying $300 for sure when you cancel your membership. Stupid agreement, you don't get agreement at all. But they always say as per agreement... Don't go there.... Worst gym and customer service in the world. They look only for money and don't care about anything else. If you say treadmill is not working, no one will listen to you. But if you order smoothie or if you need personal trainer, they will come to your home also to serve you. </p>
<p>I joined Retro Fitness in Jersey City, Hudson Mall location on May 30th, 2013. I spoke with Mike, the manager, and asked questions. There was an error in my application and I had to go to the front desk to have someone check it out. The young lady asked if I meant to check off that I have High Blood Pressure and I told her yes. She said okay and put the application through. Again I asked Mike if there was anything else I needed to know; his answer was nope, I had answered everything. I said to him, "When can I start exercising?" He said to me, "Now. You are officially a member of the gym." </p>
<p>I joined Retro Fitness online on 5/19/13. Next day, I went to the gym in New Springville, Staten Island and spoke to the GM, Phillip. He told me it would be cheaper if I joined in the store. I had him cancel my order. I told him that when the money went back into my account (I used bank VISA/ATM), I would sign up. There were also medical issues that required a doctor's note. I suffered a stroke 9 weeks ago. To date, my account has not been credited.</p>
<p>I have been trying to cancel my membership since October of 2012. When I walked into the gym with my written request to cancel, the manager talked me into staying with a waiver until Dec. Come Dec. of 2012, I sent a letter to Retro in Monroe, NY that I was still getting charged the monthly fee. In Feb 2013, I sent another letter and as of May, I was still being charged. I called the Gym and no one would talk to me, all they could say was that I was in the system as PENDING CANCELATION. I called my credit card and we blocked them and disputed the charges. My credit card company and myself spoke to ABC Financial and I owed $40. Now I am in collections for $139.95. I called them and they said I owe that amount and I was supposed to send a certified letter to the corporate office. Funny how the manager never said that to me when I was standing in front of her. This gym is a rip off and HORRIBLE!</p>
<p>Retro Fitness in Manahawkin, NJ is a horrible gym. The lack of management is ridiculous. I have been trying to cancel the membership since early February 2013. Here is my story… In January of 2013, I moved to PA and spoke to a gym representative on the phone and I was told I had to cancel in person with new license. I drove almost four hours, handed my license to the guy behind deck. He took it, played with the computer, smiled, and said he canceled it. About a month later, I get a call from ABC Financial Services stating that my account was still open and I was overdue on my account. I had called the gym about 25 times to cancel and speak to the manager that is never ever there. </p>
<p>Retro Fitness representative of Route 440 in Jersey City, New Jersey is unprofessional and terribly lacking people skills and business acumen. First of all, Retro Fitness opened late after a continuous cry of opening soon. From the first day, they began to take email address and phone number boasting of $20 a month fee. Never once was I informed that there would be additional fees with the initial signing up. I agreed to pay whatever the cost. The problem began when I asked to have my billing date the first of the month. I also agreed to pay retro for the month of May with its eight remaining days. I am retired and get a check once a month on the 1st. In order to keep from having insufficient funds penalties, I asked humbly to begin on the 1st of the month. </p>
[<p>For the price of the gym membership it's worth it. I specify 'gym' because they will try to convince you to sign up for personal training once you become a member and when you ask questions such as "Is this a monthly cost or am I only paying for eight sessions to try out the trainer without any obligation" and the manager says, "that's right you're only signing up for eight sessions and you're not bound to a contract." We just want you to sign this pad that allows us to use the same credit card on file. BEWARE! They lie to get you to sign a pad that doesn't state anything of the sort and when you find out after the fact, the eight sessions you initially thought you signed up for is really a down payment for a twelve month contract totaling $1,755.60. I asked for a refund and they pass it off to the next guy on duty. They still have not resolved the issue and it's been over two months now. Very disappointed.</p>, <p>I met with the fitness manager Tyrees to inquire about personal training sessions. At that time I was interested in obtaining personal training sessions for a month or two to kick start my plan to lose weight and get in shape. The fitness manager, Tyrees, spent about 40 minutes convincing me that if I sign up for a year program and pay the full amount of money cash in advance I will have a full comprehensive program. The full comprehensive program according to Tyrees will include: 1) a monthly progress evaluation with him personally 2) bimonthly body measurements 3) Diet evaluation and advice by my personal trainer 4) a monthly meeting with certified dietitian 5) a customized workout adjusted to my progress and ability.</p>, <p>My daughter joined Retro Fitness and we signed up for a personal trainer just so she knows what to do and how to do it correctly. We only wanted the personal trainer for 2 months, and now they are taking $210.00 out of my bank acct every month, plus $40.00 for her monthly membership fees which are only supposed to be $20.00 a month. We wrote a letter expressing we no longer need the personal trainer and she is going to give up her membership and that was 4 months ago. I am furious with these people. I call and they tell me it is a automatic renewal and I explained everything to the person on the phone we don't want the membership anymore, but come the following month, they do it again - take my money. THEY ARE RIP OFF ARTISTS.</p>, <p>I signed up with EFT at Retro. The training program was inconsistent and the trainers never follow a program or weight guide. My chart was never accurate and was filled out randomly by a trainer for training he never performed!!! After a month or so of training, I started to Feel lower back pain that transform to radiation pain to my leg. I asked to stop my training till I get treatment. I was diagnosed with herniated disk in lower back and went trough extensive physical therapy and medication. To my surprise EFT claim its really not their problem since they are covered by my liability release. In addition they send their collection agency and placed derogatory claim on my credit report for $4550!!! Needless to say that the contract was not even half of this amount!!!! Yes I agree a class action need to be taken against them!!!!</p>, <p>This gym is a master at this particular scam. When you try to cancel, they will IGNORE the letter or whatever way you cancelled. You will still continue to get billed. They will send you to collections. And they are INSANELY RUDE on the phone. I am still trying to get out of a membership. I canceled 5 MONTHS AGO!!!!</p>, <p>I had signed a 1-year contract with Retro Fitness in Deer Park, NY. My final payment under that contract was supposed to be January 19, 2014. I purposely DID NOT elect for auto renewal because of the complicated terms to cancel it. I left that part not initialed. I come to find out I had been charged for February, March, and now April. I went in to see what the deal was and they showed me a scanned image of my contract with the auto renewal initialed. My copy clearly shows it was left blank. Someone initialed it after I left!!!</p>, <p>I went in for advice on personal training, asked for one month. However, received a 12-month package. I made three appts. Each time the trainer never ever showed. Tried to cancel; however, I was told by EFT that I had three days. That's it. The person running the program called me stating he will lower the price for me. That was two days ago; still no response. The gym is beautiful. People are friendly. The training personnel are horrible. I am so upset. Something needs to be done at once.</p>, <p>Was charged an enrollment processing and maintenance fee (totaling almost $54.00) and was not told all this.</p>, <p>My situation is similar to other complaints that I've read. I cancelled my membership because of medical issues but I did complete my year membership so that I was not charged the penalty for cancelling early. I had fully planned on going back once my arm and shoulder were healed but in the meantime, my wallet was stolen with all of my credit cards in it so I cancelled my cards. Because they could not charge my card, I am being harassed by the company that bills for them. I had already met my year commitment so I do not understand why they didn't just cancel when I requested. I called the NE Philadelphia location and was instructed to email **, the General Manager, and he would take care of it. I have not had one response from **. In my email, I told them the card that they would try to charge was not valid and explained the situation. I will never go back now and will try to warn everyone that will listen what a ripoff this company is!! Go to LA Fitness. It costs more but is well worth it!</p>, <p>I signed up to Retro Fitness a few years back, in the beginning I was going quite regularly, after a while I stopped going, but I didn't plan on canceling my membership as I was planning to start going again, then for some reason there was a problem with my credit card and the charge did not go through (that was well after a year of membership) so instead of canceling my membership, they continue to try charge my card and add a penalty charge, and then send it to collection. I think this is a total ripoff strategy by Retro Fitness, that's totally unheard of, every other company with such kind membership would just simple cancel your membership. I think a CLASS ACTION needs to be filed against them.</p>, <p>This company is just a spam, they're not here to provide you service so are here to steal your money and to fool you in their contract. In tiny small letters you agree to auto renew your membership for a year unless you send a certified letter 90 days before your membership ends.</p>, <p>I joined Retro Fitness in Easton, PA in July of 2011 and made my first attempt to cancel the membership in July 2012. I specifically waited until that time because of the one year commitment, not mentioned by the person at the gym, but hidden in the contract.

<p>Unbelievable! I am very, very angry! Yes, I got poor when I was with this gym. No, they are not easy to work with. My option was either to stay with the gym or you are forced to make one or two payments as a final result. Yes, I had car problems which cost high amount of money and my account was depleted. So when the company tried to take the money out of my bank account, there was no money. Not intentional, but things happen. So what happens? A company hired by Retro Fitness for bullying and trying to delegate how you are going to pay and what due date or else! They didn't even try to work with you. I ended up with that horrible, bullying boss call by hanging up. They tried to call back and I did not answer, period! </p>
<p>I had been a member of Retro Fitness for a little over a year. I was happy with the facility. However, I moved out of state in early Sept. of 2012. I had spoken with the owner beforehand and he told me that I would have to send some info for proof of residence and they would cancel my membership. Okay, fine. I could get much info quickly enough. I called the facility and asked what proof would be sufficient enough. I did not have my license yet; I did have my water/sewer bill. That was okay. I faxed it and my machine said "transmitted" which means it was received. </p>
<p>I have been a member for years and have recently found the conditions at this Howell Retro to be deplorable. This Saturday morning, there was toilet paper on the floor in the women's bathroom and it hadn't been cleaned. I also take offense to their sending me emails to advertise their other business venture, 21 South Bar and Grille. Not a particularly good connection to the health and fitness model they project.</p>
<p>Still been trying to contact the corporate office. Surprise! No answer! They take advantage of kids, especially. We have been trying to cancel membership since last August 2012. Still no luck!</p>
<p>I signed a contract for both a year of membership (Retro Fitness) and 6 months of PT. When I started to look at my bank statements, I saw they were not taking out the $19.99 they said was due but $40 each time. When I call and ask if someone is there that can help me, they set up a meeting and then the "manager" never shows up. I put a stop payment on my bank for them. But even before that, they sent me letters from their collection agency telling me I owe or they didn't have the right bank info, even though they were taking out double from my account the entire time. I paid my dues and just want to pay what I owe the next 6 months ($20 a month). I shouldn't have to fight. They take out double or keep charging me for the PT. I saw others’ reviews and thought, “Well, that's out of state. Maybe mine wouldn't be like that since they make you feel taken cared of.” Bull! **. They are just out to ruin your credit and take your money and as long as I can pay them what I signed for, I'm fine. But until then, I will continue to tell my bank to not pay them at all no matter how much it hurts my credit.</p>
<p>Trying to cancel membership - I sent a registered letter, cancelling my policy mid-April 2012. I received a charge on my credit card end of April. I figured okay, just the residue. I got another charge end of May. I disputed bills for April and May. I received a letter from a collection agency stating I owe. I replied with the registered letter receipt number. They ignored the letter and sent another. I told my credit card company to not allow any more bills and they agreed. I just received a phone call from ABC Financial Services, saying it was urgent I respond. I did not. I did send another letter to the collection agency. We'll see how far this goes.</p>
<p>I went to sign up and check out with a friend. Since I'm only in Manahawkin during the summer (couple of months), I only wanted a short term program. They told me sure a student program, but I was not sure of it. So I declined and told them so. But since they ran my credit card, they would send me a check, which they did (check # ** for $160.47, noted-3 day cancellation refund). But then, they kept charging my credit card monthly. I had my lawyer send a letter of my cancellation and refund (3 day refund). Then they charged me back the refund amount. </p>
<p>Billing Dispute - I signed up for a one-year membership at Retro Fitness in Dix Hills/Huntington NY area, that was to continue each month after that year was up and would cost me $20, being charged to my credit card. First off I hardly used the membership because of a back injury. I had a 3 level lumbar fusion surgery done in November of 2010. I was cut open from an inch over my belly button, all the way down to the crotch line. My insides were taken out. They then took out 3 discs replacing them with spacers, 3 cages,with 9 screws to hold it all in place. They then put me back together, flipped me over and sliced me 3 times in my back, while inserting a Titanium rod and 2 more screws to hold that in place.</p>
<p>My daughter went to work out and take her free training session that came with her membership. Apparently, they sold her a year's training in the amount of $2000.00. At that time she was told that she could cancel anytime, but apparently this is not so. She feels embarrassed that she was taken advantage of. She is a college student with no income. We have tried to explain this to several people, but no one wants to hear anything.</p>
<p>My identity got stolen and I tried to have a civilized conversation with Charlie, the female owner of Retro Fitness, and she immediately began yelling that she doesn't care about my problem and I can simply pay what I owe to get out of the contract. I explained to her that that money was tied up due to fraud, but again, all she did was yell and constantly remind how she doesn't care about my problems and that I am "locked" in a contract and must pay or else she will send the collections after me. I asked twice for the corporate office and she hung up the phone. She hung up. Instead of talking, she resorted to childish behavior.</p>
<p>My 15 year old son went in to get information about the gym.  They let him fill out a gym membership and started to take money from his account.  Now this is on his credit report.  I would like his money to be returned to him and that you remove this off his credit report.</p>
<p>People like the owner/manager Michael Padula are tools. Let me define tool. A tool is an apparatus or a (person) to get something done. To some, the word tool may have a much stronger derogatory meaning, but to me, it's an oversimplified sort of person. My contract with Retro Fitness was terminated because Padula got complaints from his staff and clients. I was not notified that I had such a caustic effect on some of the folks in the space. Padula is a tool, and tools like Padula think very 2 dimensionally. There is no reason why a gym should be run by a tool. I am the gregarious/friendly sort. One very unique trait is I am bluntly honest. Most people cannot handle my level of complete transparency. Padula, members of his staff, and some clients are just too narrow-minded and ignorant to enjoy their surroundings, and the people around them. Live, love, enjoy!</p>
<p>I called the billing company to cancel contract at contract's end in 1 week. I was told I had to go to the health club to fill out "paperwork" to cancel. The health club manager insisted I needed to send a certified letter requesting termination. The contract specifically states written notice need to be provided 60 days prior to "auto renewal" I was told.  This is in direct violation of New Jersey code 56:8-42 in regulating health club contracts that states "A health club services contract shall not obligate the buyer to renew the contract." </p>
<p>I was offered and signed on for a comprehensive personal training program that included my past, present and future fitness goals, strength and endurance training and a diet program for weight loss. Upon my second visit I was informed that I would not be given a diet plan as they were not dietitians. I had informed the trainer that I had a low back and shoulder injury; however he continuously instructed me to perform exercises and/or lift weights too heavy for my fitness level. I received no endurance program, and when asked was told that I looked like I knew what I was doing. </p>
<p>On November 28, 2007, my 17 year old daughter entered a one year agreement with this gym. She had her monthly amount of 21.39 deducted from her checking account. On September 4, 2008, we sent a letter requesting that her membership be discontinued due to her attendance at college. We sent the letter certified mail, return receipt requested, as required on the contract. However, the letter came back to us stating there is no such address. We double-checked the address on the contract and it was clearly sent to the right address. </p>
[<p>Unbelievable! I am very, very angry! Yes, I got poor when I was with this gym. No, they are not easy to work with. My option was either to stay with the gym or you are forced to make one or two payments as a final result. Yes, I had car problems which cost high amount of money and my account was depleted. So when the company tried to take the money out of my bank account, there was no money. Not intentional, but things happen. So what happens? A company hired by Retro Fitness for bullying and trying to delegate how you are going to pay and what due date or else! They didn't even try to work with you.

I was happy with the facility. However, I moved out of state in early Sept. of 2012.

But even before that, they sent me letters from their collection agency telling me I owe or they didn't have the right bank info, even though they were taking out double from my account the entire time. I paid my dues and just want to pay what I owe the next 6 months ($20 a month). I shouldn't have to fight. They take out double or keep charging me for the PT. I saw others’ reviews and thought, “Well, that's out of state. Maybe mine wouldn't be like that since they make you feel taken cared of.” Bull! **.
