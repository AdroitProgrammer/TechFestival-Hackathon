<p>They have the worst customer service and they were so rude with me. I asked for a refund or a voucher of what I paid for the hotel because I couldn’t travel so I want to cancel my booking. Here is my story. I applied for an Indian visa but they did not give me the visa so it is out of my hand. I explained this to Hotels.com. They did not help me. The customer service only said "we’re sorry we cannot help you" and that’s it!!!</p>
<p>They have the worst customer service which provided redundant solutions and even asked us to use unlawful means to contact our credit card company and report as fraud transaction. Please do not book your vacation through them as they won't fight for their customers.</p>
<p>I booked a room using Hotels.com, was going to a Fleetwood Mac concert. The day of the show (today) the band cancelled. I was on the phone over an hour trying to get my card refunded. Bottom line, they would not refund my money, or let me change the date. $254.00 for nothing.</p>
<p>I recently booked a reservation through Hotels.com for a San Francisco hotel. 20 minutes after booking a prepaid hotel, I realized I had made an error on my dates. I immediately called Hotels.com and asked to cancel the reservation. They gave me the runaround, promised to email the hotel request a cancellation without penalties. 24 hours later, I received an email from the Hotels.com stating that the Hotel denied any cancellation without penalties and there was nothing they could do. Irritated, I went ahead and traveled to San Francisco.</p>
<p>I recently joined Hotels.com and upon completing my registration, the site did not clearly mention how to enroll in the reward program. After signing into the site, the enroll option mentioned by their customer support is not displayed, confirming to me that they do not want you to get rewards. I called customer service and it was a waste of time. They are obviously aware of the issue and their customer service personal is trained to give customer the run about. You would be better off dealing directly with the hotel establishment and avoid at any cost HOTELS.COM. Hope that my bad experience will serve someone else.</p>
<p>Hotels.com has always been a bit unreliable but now I see they are downright shady. I'm using their customer service for the first time...and wow. I was booking a hotel that I trust and have stayed at before (`$150) then I see a similar location slightly less quality hotel for $118...so I check it out and Hotels.com says there's 2 prices $139 and $118 the secret price (should have been a red flag but I don't distrust the site yet so...). I say, "Go ahead" and on the final screen after clicking purchase I see there's a fee tacked on making the room $139 (remember the normal price). No warning etc. </p>
<p>I cancelled a 2 night, 2 room reservation through Hotels.com. The rep I spoke with assured me that both rooms would be cancelled, but my credit card was charged for one room. I called Customer Service and provided the cancellation number. At first the person tried to pawn me off on the hotel, but I insisted this was Hotels.com's mistake. </p>
<p>YOU ARE BETTER OFF USING THE HOTEL CHAIN WEBSITE - SINCE I BOOKED THROUGH HOTELS.COM COULD NOT CANCEL. COULD HAVE canceled if used the hotel website. The operator in India did nothing and offered no help. Waste of money. No service. Bait and switch. Since said I could cancel when booking through Hotels.com.</p>
<p>I booked 7 different hotel reservation thru Hotels.com for a trip. One of the hotels closed at 9 pm and the owner of the hotel called earlier that day to say he would leave a Room key in the mailbox. There was a envelope with parking pass, beach access but NO room key. We called the hotel, no answer, left a message and they never returned the call. We ended up going to another hotel. When disputing the charge with Hotels.com they said they couldn't reach the owner of the hotel and could not refund my money without his permission. Also, I had gift cards for Hotels.com, but when booking online you could only use 1 at a booking. Try to call and book they will not take their own gift cards. What a ripoff company. I've been using Hotels.com for years but no more. Too many other ways to book a hotel room. Stay away from this site. Customer service very poor.</p>
<p>If I can give 0 star I would, we booked hotel half year ago, and last minute we received e-mail from Hotels.com that due to overbooking they switch us from hotel to worse than Motel 6 without any compensation. We complained to Hotels.com and they cancel us reservation and wanted us book another hotel with double price, it’s outrageous, bad service. We will never use them again for sure, please be aware when you book rooms with them!!!</p>
<p>I have never reserved a room and had the funds taken immediately, A nonrefundable, upfront, paid reservation. For those of us that are not rich and live paycheck to paycheck, this is a horrible service. I will never use them again. Wish I had never given them the opportunity to book for me.</p>
<p>I have been an avid Hotels.com user for several years. I honestly at my wit's end with these folks. I have called in several times regarding my account lists my business partner's name. I have simply asked to take him off my account. I have gone in several times with my PC, not the app on my phone. Changes don't take, but they still insist every time I call that it will be in effect in 72 hrs. I have lost several free nights stays as a result. Cannot book any new hotel stays, nor redeem any of the lost nights. Goodbye Hotels.com/Expedia... I am now going back to using my Hilton Honors, never an issue with them with redemption or communication. I guess if your customer service provides zero service, it might be time to get out of the service industry.</p>
<p>Recently I booked a reservation thru Hotels.com. I was quoted a price from Hotels.com and when I checked in to hotel I was given a cheaper price and at checkout the same low price on the folio printout I was given at checkout. When questioning Hotels.com I was rudely told that hotel should not have given me the lower price or printout by hotel and that Hotels .com can charge any price they want. When I stated that was not fair the agent said “how do you expect us to make money.” And she said Hotel.com services are not free.</p>
<p>My cad$1200+ is gone with the wind! I booked with Hotels.com a 4 nights stay in London and I'm sure it's under the pay at the hotel column. When I received the confirmation email it states my booking is fully paid and charge on my credit card. The email also state, "Cancellation policy Free cancellation until 03/18/2019 00:00 (GMT+00:00)." I did the cancellation after 3 minutes thinking my travel plan may still change later on and I still have time for the free cancellation. I received the cancellation email after 3 minutes of booking and later on learn I am not entitled to any refund. </p>
<p>I flew with my son, his friend and the friend's father to the RHCP concert in Giza, Egypt. Since many tourists were expected to arrive at the show, we ordered in advance (January 31st) and booked two rooms through the Hotels.com website. We've completed our reservation, including entering the credit card details. After two days we received an email from Hotels.com confirming the booking.</p>
<p>We booked a hotel which seem to be fine and we went to check in. We were told Hotels.com put us at a different hotel. The hotel they sent us to was the worst hotel I have ever seen. We checked in and went to look at the room and almost died. We just left and had to find a different hotel and pay again for the night. Do not use this company, you don't know where you will end up at. This should not be allowed, asked the manager if a thing could be done and he said no, it's our loss.</p>
<p>My daughter and I stayed an unsafe and dirty hotel. The room to smelled like weed, a hair pick was on the floor and the bathroom window was broken to where it does not close all the way. We were only going to be in San Francisco for a short time so we decided just to deal with it. As we were sleeping we heard inappropriate sexual activity from the room above us. We then also heard people yelling, cursing and appearing to be under the influence of substances. As we walked down the stairs in the morning, a man that appeared to be homeless and drugged out cat called my daughter and myself. There were also a bunch of people that again to appear to be homeless people and the police were on the premises as well.</p>
<p>I booked a 3 night stay with this website and drove 12 hours to my destination. When me and my family got there no reservation, and the hotel Sweden House SF said it's the website's fault and I not only lost $300, but because it was fraud my bank card got stopped/reset. Not only wtf but can't get a room without a bank card at 12 am with our 11 month year old son... WOW.</p>
<p>I never am one to write reviews. I had a horrible experience booking. I booked the wrong date by accident for hotel and they will not refund me or exchange dates. I am going to the media ... these crooks!!!</p>
<p>I usually do not write reviews but based on my recent experience with Hotels.com’s customer service, I feel compelled to provide insight and warn prospective consumers of how bad this company is when it comes to customer service. Below provides a summarized list of what went wrong:</p>
<p>I booked a hotel through them for my son's baseball tourney. After I hit confirm they sent me an email which had the wrong date, not the date I put in. I'm 110% sure of my date because I'm weird and check over things 10,000 times before confirming. Anyways they refused to change it to the right date or give me my money of $265 back!! Crooks!</p>
<p>Sadly Hotels.com prioritizes profit over promises made to customers. Booked a three-day hotel stay, didn't get the room we booked and had to move elsewhere after the first night due to bugs and dirty sheets. Then got told by Hotels.com they believed the hotel's claim that we got the room we booked and that neither of them were willing to do anything further. Classic scam made worse by the company's refusal to even listen. Finally managed on the third attempt to get a partial refund (not even worth a single night's stay), never again.</p>
<p>I made a reservation in Newport RI at the Viking Hotel for one evening. Confirmation indicated Total Amount due at hotel: $172.93 and under made note of charge at hotel of resort fee $30.00... which indicated inclusive... However I was actually charged $205.03. When I called Hotels.com to express my concern over how the charges are indicated the agent 3 times said it is a resort fee... To which I said I understand that is not what I am contesting. Asked to speak to a manager who was extremely rude. Once again I understood what the charge was for... My dispute was how they are not upfront with it... And 3 times in the confirmation state total amount due $172.93. I will not do any future business with a rude unethical company.</p>
<p>Two bookings in a row the hotel gave away my room and I was downgraded. I contacted Hotels.com and the customer service was awful. They kept pointing to a policy that wasn’t written anywhere, and when I showed them every policy that WAS written they thanked me for pointing out the discrepancy, and still told me I should have known this unwritten policy. The customer service team ignored my specific request to not contact the hotels that night, which made it awkward when I was still at one hotel and they had already addressed the issue so were confused what I needed. Hotels.com did provide a credit to compensate for their poor service, but refused to pursue the matter with the hotels — if I’m supposed to be in a king and I have two doubles (or two twins!), I need to be paid back for the difference in room price. Two terrible experiences in a row AND terrible customer service when I raise the issue? Hard pass, I won’t be using Hotels.com again.</p>
<p>I recently booked accommodations through Hotels.com - taking careful note of the small print as it was a condo and not a hotel chain. I even phoned and talked to an agent regarding the accommodations. 24 hours later I received a text message from a random number asking for my credit card information, a $500 deposit and a copy of my passport (???) I called the number and verified that it was actually the condo leasing company. I stated that not only was I not comfortable with providing this information insecurely but that there was nothing on the site asking for it. The gentlemen said it was standard practice, understood my concerns and offered various secure alternatives we could agree on.</p>
<p>I travel to the same hotel once a month for work &amp; my company books the hotel using this website. I have never had a problem. Until yesterday. Yesterday was SO bad that I asked my company to not use them again to book my rooms &amp; to book directly with the hotel or use another booking site. Hotels.com NEVER sent the hotel my reservation. I had a confirmation number but unfortunately the hotel doesn’t use a booking sites conf. #’s. This has never happened before so I wasn’t that annoyed. UNTIL I CALLED Hotels.com!!! I explained my situation and I was put on hold after giving them my confirmation number. </p>
<p>This would be a zero star if I could. I created a booking on Hotels.com for Country Inn and Suites Downtown Atlanta and given an overbooking situation that I had at another hotel, I called to inquire about the room availability. The young man I spoke to over the phone told me that there was no room available if I had just made that reservation. I asked him to cancel it so that I was not charged. He said, "no problem." I then booked at a third hotel (which was 50$ more a night and farther away - therefore much more expensive to Uber to). I then spoke to Hotels.com that evening and asked for my reservations to be cancelled. "No problem. You will not be charged", I was told. </p>
<p>These awful, horrible people do not deserve to be in business. This is literally a "get what you pay for" situation. I tried to cancel my reservation FOUR MONTHS before my anticipated stay and they refuse to refund my money without charging me a $100 fee. Their website claimed I would not have to pay until I got there, I followed up with the hotel and was assured of the same. Then, I was charged me over $450 on a stay that is months away and they WILL NOT give me my money back. We had to change our reservations because my elderly mother is moving in with us that week and every person I spoke to just kept telling me there was nothing they could do. Horrible, just horrible. I'm out $450 for a vacation I will never be able to take, despite the fact that they claim to have a 24-hour cancellation policy. Stay away, stay far, far away.</p>
<p>The customer service for this website is horrible. I lost my gift card, tried the chat help. They gave me a number to call. That number said they only dealt with eCards, being a third party company, so they couldn't help and they gave me another number. Called them, they said they'd transfer me to their gift card department, (isn't that who I was transferred to??). The person on that end was from the same third party company that couldn't help me. </p>
<p>Delta SkyMiles "partner site" get points reserving through them. It's just Hotels.com. Online free cancelation does not work. Requires you to call. Gave me Delta SkyMiles number to call. After 2 hrs of being told by various Delta departments that I had to call a different number I was finally told I had to call hotels.com. Another 1.5 hrs of my life I will never get back. Their policy states refund process in 24 hrs. However after an insane amount t of time, connecting with specialist, then they had to call hotel "to see if you can get a refund". Excuse me? They tell me "72 hrs to process". I remind them of their stated policy but am told they need to get their "escalation team" to review it because they are getting an error. No kidding? You mean the same error I was complaining about in the first place when I tried to cancel online?! Delta SkyMiles = irresponsible. Hotels.com = crooks!</p>
<p>We have lost our trust With Hotels.Com. We have trusted lot Hotels.com, but you have spoiled it by simply delegating your job to OYO. And end of day no one is ready to take the responsibility. You cannot leave by simple delegating your work to OYO. Finally you are responsible to all end results. We have booked 3 rooms in Ooty through Hotels.Com, but it was badly diverted into Oyo Hotel booking, and we have made the payment for 3 rooms (@ ** international) through Oyo. I have got the booking conformation email from Hotels.com, and all the SMS notification from OYO. not sure what responsibility shared between them.</p>
<p>Called to check if a hotel they listed was indeed pet friendly. Operator immediately assumed we wanted under 100 dollars and that nothing will work for us. After a confused explanation of not caring if it's over 100 dollars (all we wanted was a simple yes or no on pet friendly) the guy refused to let us off the phone citing business practices and trying to ram a sale down our throats. Finally, after about 10 minutes of my wife explaining we were simply verifying, I had to tell him we will take our business elsewhere and hang up. The overall experience was unprofessional and off-putting. This is what you get when you outsource customer support.</p>
<p>I booked a room with Hotels.com. For 21 days paid upfront. I have the receipt for 1225.50 and confirmation #. Our reservation was confirmed January 3rd 2019 7:51 pm. Upon our arrival, we were told our reservation had been canceled by Trivago for fraud! We were due there around 12 or 1 pm. We arrived around 12:40. Pm. I called Hotels.com, and was told to give a phone # and we would receive a call back within an hour. </p>
<p>Hotels.com is ripoff – they said you will collect night – after 6 days stay, I didn’t collectable night – they said if coupon used you will not get rewarded nights :) and they send email to use coupon. LOL. Hilarious – I will make sure dont use these folks for future reservation. Yes, fine print manipulator, this is how I see them. I think it not much about night collection, it's just unreasonable things bother.</p>
<p>I am writing this review after being a loyal member of hotels.com for the past 2 years and after having booked more than a 100 nights. 100 Nights! You would think they would value you with Rewards &amp; at least honor your request in some avoidable medical conditions. Sorry, they won't. Quoting them - "We don't own the property and so we cannot refund any money (even if your doctor says you cannot travel anymore to unsafe countries), if the property rejects the request." There lies the difference between a hotel chain and hotels.com or a expedia.com.</p>
<p>I purchased e-gift cards that are no longer valid. I have not used any of them but customer service says from non use they expired. I purchased e-gift cards from Hotels.com for my parents. When trying to redeem them I was told they were invalid from non use. I spent 3 hours on the phone with customer service where they kept transferring me to a new person. They will not reissue these. I told them that there is not an expiration date on any of these gift certificates. I was also told that one of the gift cards was used in Florida. My parents live in Massachusetts and have not left the state since 2013. I feel we are being defrauded by this company who knowingly took my money for gift cards. </p>
<p>We booked through their site and paid in advance. The hotel still gave us a bill, which was odd, but it was good to see that Hotels.com charged us 30 dollars over per night compared to the hotel. When I tried to resolve it, Hotels.com won't give a credit or refund if there is a lower price if the price is found after check in. Compared with other people's experiences, I suppose we got lucky in that the hotel didn't charge us as well, because that was what they were going to do. Apparently they weren't aware that I had paid in advance? So the lines of communication are not working between the two vendors. Fortunately I was able to resolve it with the hotel and not get double charged. However, I will never book through Hotels.com again.</p>
<p>Something went wrong with the Hotels.com app and it booked two hotels instead of one. I called their Customer Service straight away. I then spoke to 3 different Hotels.com people on the phone. The first one hung up at some point for no reason and never called back. The second tried to call the hotel and never called me back. The third one said she would cancel the reservation (she didn't) and transfer my request to the Resolution team, who was supposed to get back to me within 24 hours. I'm still waiting for their call. In total I spent over 3 hours on the phone in less than 36 hours to find a solution and nobody helped me. This is ridiculous, outrageous, and is by far the worst customer experience I've ever had in my life. And I travel quite a lot.</p>
<p>Bad service was received from Hotels.com employees (Philippines). I emailed on the 21st of December to change a booking (from 2 nights to 1 night). Also called on the 27th of December to change the booking, both in time for the FREE CANCELLATION policy. I get a phone call on the 1st of January 2019, where Hotels.com has said they are unable to assist with the change as their systems are down. How is this my fault where I will now be charged for both nights where I wanted to change it for 1 night as I won't be in the area for both nights. This is pathetic and so unprofessional. Will probably be charged for this too. Will have to see. This is the first and last time I would ever use Hotels.com and will never recommend anyone to use this site.</p>
<p>Hotels.com states that once you have reached 10 nights of bookings over a designated time period you will receive one night free. I followed their guidelines and was told that I had reached my one free night. When I attempted to book a hotel using the one free night reward, it was not possible as the redemption was locked. I called Hotels.com five times about this. I was told how sorry they were and that they would correct this if I would hold on. I held on each time for anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half. </p>
<p>On a trip to New Orleans we had found out that our Airbnb reservation was cancelled by the owner while we were on our layover in Houston. With such short notice we booked a hotel through Hotels.com for 5 nights. (Wyndham Garden Airport Hotel) On arriving in New Orleans we checked in and quickly realized the hotel was completely unsatisfactory. The TV didn’t work. The floor had staples coming through the carpet. The restaurant had 10 items on the menu and 5 were out. We decided to spend some more money and change hotels for the rest of our stay. NOPE!!!</p>
<p>I booked through Hotels.com with 10nights so I could get a free night. Seemed worth it. Not. I paid 10 nights then they red flagged my account and said my free night was forfeited. Never book through here.</p>
<p>I booked a stay which I was told would be refundable due to their advertising and website, had to cancel due to a medical emergency and now they refuse to refund almost 600.00. Do not do business with this company.</p>
<p>I have booked 4 nights and got charged twice for same stay (one from Hotels.com and other from hotel itself) but to my surprise there is price difference of $125, Hotels.com is charging more, the hotel money will be refunded but the surprise is Hotels.com doesn't give best price they will overcharge you. So what I see is they penalized my $31.25 for using Hotels.com. They are paying deaf ears for reimbursement. I don't how to give zero stars. They are ripping off. Don't ever use Hotels.com.</p>
<p>So disappointed in Hotels.com. Had 4 gift cards for $500 each stolen. Called CS immediately after being on the phone for an hour and transferred from one dept to another, the stolen cards were cashed in and I am out the money. I asked for the cards to be deactivated put on lock something. It seems that thieves like Hotels.com but I have now found out they have no way of turning off a card and someone can have a card combined with another and they can’t trace it.</p>
<p>We reserved a hotel through hotels.com for two nights at $200/night. We ended up cancelling the second night through the hotel and Hotels.com changed the daily rate to $100 for the first night (Saturday which is usually the premium day of the week) and $300 for the second night (Sunday night). This is a fraudulent scheme. We have had similar problems with them on other reservations. I will never use their services again.</p>
<p>I booked a 1 night stay through Hotels.com and they charged me 124.55 for my room. The hotel gave me a receipt for my room and it said the room charge was 107.06. I contacted hotels.com to ask who I need to speak with the get reimbursed my 17.49 and the lady I spoke with said I had received the best rate at 124.55 and there wasn’t anything she could do for me. I told her obviously I didn’t receive the best offer if the hotel was only charging 107.06. I have never had troubles in the past with them but now I will never use them again and neither should anyone else.</p>
<p>Is there is a 0-star option? Hotels.com is the worst hotel booking site I ever tried. Please read it carefully, the idea of writing comments is to tell others what to expect when using Hotels.com. Customer service letterly don't care about you, I booked a place for family vacation, the place was extremely horrible (I will not go through the details but was really bad). No one can stay there for 1 night. Contacted them, reserved another place for a price of last moment reservation with Hotels.com and not to mention the hassle... Now what next:</p>
<p>I am a regular customer of Hotels.com. I always use this site to book out hotels. My recent trip in Houston was charged almost $20 more than the actual rates of the Hotel I was staying at. They promote deceiving ads like 50% off Schemes and secret prices.</p>
<p>I prepaid for a hotel room through Hotel.com, then received a receipt from the hotel for $18 LESS than I had paid. Hotel.com refused to refund the money. Do NOT book a hotel through them. They will rip you off.</p>
<p>Our story is the same as below. Booked a ten day stay through Hotels.com. We received an email saying we paid in full and had a confirmed booking, we received another confirmation from the Four Seasons Hotel &amp; Resort as well as welcome letter. Also had conversations with Hotel managers who confirmed our reservation. And then received this email from Hotels.com cancelling our reservation or asking us to pay thousands of dollars more to secure our reservation.</p>
<p>11 days after booking Hotels.com sent me an email asking for additional money to keep the booking or alternatively cancel reservation stating obvious mistake clause. I was puzzled and asked them what they mean by obvious mistake. It is an arbitrary term unless their contract describes what obvious mistake means. They replied with using additional part of contract that states they can cancel any booking anytime for any reason. So basically if you book through Hotels.com you are at their mercy. They expect customers to guarantee their end but there is zero guarantee and responsibility on Hotels.com's part even though my confirmation email reads guaranteed and paid for.</p>
<p>We booked a family trip, with small kids, in Belgium in Belcasa Family Suites &amp; Lofts with Hotels.com. Arrived late, they sent us some email with instruction. When we arrived to the hotel location, opened the safe with provided password... Nothing! Empty. Called all possible phone numbers, no answer, no reply, and we had to stay in another hotel that night. It turns out that this shady hotel actually a real estate company and they keep their keys 4 km away in a small office of their another property. The email they sent us did not explain well this point, and was written in gibberish French. We asked for refund from the hotel, they refused and called us a liars. We asked Hotels.com to step in. They did nothing. </p>
<p>I would strongly advise anybody against using Hotels.com. Under their terms and conditions, they claim they are allowed to cancel any bookings that are listed at an incorrect price where there is an obvious error and informed me of this by email with regards to one of my bookings. I asked them where their definition on obvious errors were in the t's and c's as this was very subjective and not obvious to me. They ignored both of my emails and then proceeded to lie telling me they made numerous attempts at calling and emailing - I know this because the manager on the phone confirmed they received them. </p>
<p>Worst customer service ever! Phone got disconnected once we confirmed the price match. After that no one calls back and managers refuse to help you. In fact, if you ask for a manager, they will consistently transfer you to another reservation agent. After another request, they will transfer you to a “manager” who has absolutely no authority to help you at all. The only thing they can do is make a reservation. If you have a complaint, they will hang up on you after they realize that you are not making a booking. This process happened over and over again on the same day. Do not use them!</p>
<p>I have used Hotels.com multiple times and was originally pleased with the results. Their hotel rewards offer is what really drew my husband and myself to continue to book through their website. This was, however, up until my most recent trip. Apparently I received $5 off my 4 night stay at a hotel in Paris, and as a result (not aware before) I lost out on adding those 4 nights to my already accumulating hotel nights. I called customer service after the trip and offered to pay the $5 (since $5 is clearly not equal to 4 nights) but they kept going back to their “terms and conditions” stating they couldn’t make it right for me (the customer). Additionally, it’s confusing because the coupon merely stated it couldn’t be combined with any other promotional offers which I did not believe included collecting their hotel nights. I will never use their site again and do not recommend them when there are many other options available.</p>
<p>I booked and cancel a hotel in Toronto, Ontario through the Hotels.com near October 2018. They confirmed the total charged amount $0 before cancel. Also, it confirmed $0 after completing cancel process. But, I found the hotels.com partner took $650 later. Thus, I requested refund it from the hotels.com and its partner company. They refused because of their policy which was not mentioned on my confirmation data. There is non-refund statement policy on cancellation I already paid. However, it was $0 I paid. If I had known my paid amount was $650+, I would not cancelled. I couldn't sleep well for this. I need a lawyer but it lawyer fee will be bigger than refund. Please transfer this story to your friends via internet. I have screenshot and email with confirmation. I am wondering hotels.com is USA company? Or Canadian Company? From Sleeping-not-well Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>I don't recall making the reservation with Hotels.com. I never received a confirmation that I had a reservation at Castle Inn. They were not able to send me a correctly dated copy of the reservation. Somewhere between Hotels.com and Castle Inn things got screwed up. No refund was offered by Castle Inn.</p>
<p>I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights at Ruby Hotel. Ruby Hotel (OTM11-8 Lotus Residences, Hoang Quoc Viet, Hung Thang Ward, Halong, Vietnam) through Hotels.com and used my debit card. When we arrived at the hotel, we were told that they did not receive any confirmation from Hotels.com. Take note, that was 6 days prior to our arrival. We showed to them the confirmation email and the paid amount but they still did not acknowledge it. It was a stressful 9 hour trip just to arrive with no booked room! We were given an option to stay in the hotel but pay for 2 nights plus deposit and was asked to leave our passports! What the hell!</p>
<p>We tried booking a reservation through Hotels.com, on their website under the "your booking" section, there was a prompt that stated the 'room is not available'. So we went ahead and booked a new reservation also using Hotels.com. Turns out, we were charged for both. We called customer service several times and hours later on the phone, they said they couldn't do anything. We are never using Hotels.com again. They take people's hard earn money and have no regard for customer service.</p>
<p>Booked 2 rooms with Hotel.com. Arrived at hotel to find no rooms available. Told that Hotel.com consistently overbooks. Hotels.com would give no assistance in finding other rooms. They are now fighting Credit Card company to refund charges to my credit card. Use them to find hotel, then book directly with hotel so you get a room.</p>
<p>Do not book using Hotels.com ever! I booked through them and the information was not clear on the APP. I travel for work and I know when at the time of making a reservation you have to pay in advance. Well, I was charged with $180 and something. I called and this lady (very rude) told me that is nothing they can do and I have to move forward. I requested to speak with the Manager and she told me that she need it some time to talk to the hotel and confirm their policies (which is understandable) and get back to me. Then the next day she sent this email confirming the refund and everything. I was very happy. This was Nov 19.</p>
<p>Do NOT EVER book through Hotels.com. It is beyond misrepresented and shady! I booked a hotel room over a week in advance! I received several confirmations as well as confirmation number for my hotel. When I arrived to hotel at 12:30am they showed no reservation for me, the desk clerk typed in my confirmation number and it didn’t come up, he typed my name and nothing, he tried using my cell phone number and then my email address all epic fails!!! </p>
<p>I had a horrible experience with Hotels.com. This is my personal view and opinion of Hotels. com. I booked a hotel/resort stay with them for my trip to PCB Florida in May. At that time of our trip, the Florida panhandle was preparing for tropical storm Alberto. After the state of Florida declared a State of Emergency, we decided to cancel our trip. We did not want to jeopardize our safety. I called to cancel my reservation. After explaining the situation, I was informed that the resort had been contacted during our phone conversation and that Hotels.com would process a refund on our reservation. I was led to believe that the situation had been taken care and was told to expect an email with information regarding my refund. </p>
<p>We were charged $75.00 more than the Candlewood Suites charged us. The hotel tried to get us a refund but could not. I'm trying to work with my credit card company to get this refunded. Stay away from Hotels.com!</p>
<p>With so many other options available, you would think that Hotels.com would try to outshine the others with customer service - especially with long time customers. I have used Hotels.com many times with no incident and have never had to contact their customer service. A few months ago, while traveling, I made a reservation to check in that same day. Normally, after completing a reservation, I receive a confirmation number immediately and an email confirming the reservation, that did not occur this time. I checked my account on Hotels.com and I did not have any upcoming bookings. Because I never received a confirmation number, did not receive an email, and the website showed no bookings, I made another reservation at a different hotel in the area on Hotels.com. </p>
<p>Buyer beware. Avoid this company at all costs. I've used them many many times without incident. The one time I showed up at the hotel in Fresno in October of 2018 was not able to rent the room due to an issue with my ID. Called Hotels.com from the lobby. Was told the money would be refunded to my card. We made another reservation at another hotel. To this date I have not seen the refund almost 45 days later. I've called over 30 times. Each time I told the exact same thing. I will get call back in 1 or 3 hours, they have no way of contacting the department that issues the refunds and that I will just have to wait the one to three hours. Some people call me back. Nobody ever does. </p>
<p>I booked a hotel through hotels.com. I got caught in a snowstorm and was stranded on the highway for 4 hours. When I got off the highway, I contacted Hotels.com and told them that I couldn't call them before the cancellation time because of the storm. We were told by the police that there was a travel ban and I was stuck an hour away from where I was supposed to be. They called the hotel and arranged for them to change my reservation to the next night. The agent told me that I would not be getting an email because it was changed directly by the hotel and not her. When I arrived at the hotel the next day, they told me they had no such reservation. Basically Hotels.com lied. People who are stranded in a snowstorm on a shutdown highway, should not have to pay for a hotel they could not get to. Thanks to the management at the hotel, I was able to get a room the next night. I will never use Hotels.com again. They are shady and they lie.</p>
<p>I have been a Hotels.com client/member of their rewards program and have used 10 free nights (that I earned) so far. I look on their site first and have had excellent results finding something in my price range. Not happy with the add on taxes and fees that show up when you go to book, and usually end up checking with Booking.com to see if there is a big price difference but usually on par. When I have used the phone help to change a stay or question something the help is quick and concise. I am very satisfied.</p>
<p>I have used this company several times without serious issue. This last summer I was going to do a cross country trip and stayed in hotels for most of two weeks. Hotels.com advertised on its site how if you use their site they will give you a free room for every 10 reservations. I thought this was perfect since I was going to stay at hotels anyways. For my trip, I stayed at only Hotels.com hotels and reserved them all via their app on my phone. I never received a status email nor did it tell me how close I was on the app. Today I called in after making another reservation (my 12th since that trip across country). I’m told by the rep that I never enrolled in the rewards program. I told them I used their app and have an account with them, so how am I not enrolled. They said it’s a separate program. </p>
<p>I booked a hotel using Hotels.com. The reviews posted there were reasonable. The day of travel I pulled up the hotel on GPS and noticed the hotel reviews there were way lower than what Hotels.com had posted. The hotel was gross, bed bug infested, and roach infested. I immediately called to cancel. The Hotels.com rep was rude and unconcerned and no help at all. I then called the next day and still got no resolution. They refused to refund my money even after I showed them the reviews and made them aware of the issues. I ended up having to get another hotel and paying twice. AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS.</p>
<p>We booked a room through Hotels.com (or so we thought) in advance for the Grey Cup thinking that if our team made it we would go. Their policy is payment in full upfront but you can get a full refund if you cancel 1 week in advance. Unfortunately our team lost so I went into my email to find the reservation so I could cancel and to my surprise there was no confirmation email!?! First shady dealings. I phoned the hotel and they told me they couldn't cancel the reservation, that it had to be done through the booking agent and they had it listed as Hotelbeds.com??? I told her I never booked it through them that I booked it through Hotels.com and she said she didn't know what happened but that's the name and it shows paid in full. She gave me a phone number for them but when I called all it said was they were closed, try again later. </p>
<p>I will NEVER use this website to book ever again. I tried to cancel a reservation 2 weeks in advance and I was told that I could cancel it but that I wouldn't get a refund. I was told that this reservation stated 'Non Refundable" but every reservation on there stated that. On top of all this, the email I received stated that I could cancel my reservation 1 year prior to the check-in day. My reservation was for 11/30/2018 and the cancel free of charge date was 11/30/2017. This is by far the WORST experience I have ever had with booking a hotel and I will be sure to spread the word of Hotels.com's terrible scam and horrible customer service. Shame on you for ripping people off!</p>
<p>I booked a room in June for a trip in December. I am taking my husband and parents to a football game for Christmas. The hotel I booked is in walking distance to the stadium. There was an undecided meeting on my work calendar for that Friday, but I booked the hotel and chose the more expensive option too, and I quote, "cancel or change your booking up until your stay". The meeting was confirmed yesterday (November 18), so I called this morning to change my stay to just Saturday night instead of Friday. I WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT DO THIS. Let me say that again, I just wanted to CANCEL a day of my reservation, and despite having reserved with the additional cost for just such an occurrence, they told me they couldn't honor their claim. The excuse they gave was that they would have to cancel my entire reservation and the hotel was booked so they couldn't book me a new room. </p>
<p>I utilized Hotels.com to book a trip in June of 2018. When I arrived, the hotel had been sold and was going through a renovation leaving it in disarray. I called customer service to book a new hotel and Hotels.com issues a coupon towards my next reservation. On 11/16/18 I called to book the reservation only to be told that the code had already been used by someone in INDONESIA but I am in Texas!!! The customer service person nor their manager would acknowledge and would not provide another coupon code despite the fact that none of the information used for the reservation matched my information. Buyer beware! Their systems may have been hacked. I could not even pronounce the name of the person who was associated with the code nor the city in which the code had been used.</p>
<p>Be wary of a company that charges you full price at the time of booking. They indicate they do not charge a cancellation fee, however they kept the full amount of my room after I cancelled. Deal with the hotel directly, and cut out the shady middleman.</p>
<p>On November 15th I made a reservation with HOTELS.COM for a room in New York city for an employee who was stuck there. I called the customer service who verified my reservation and took payment from me for the hotel room. When my employee went to the hotel in the evening she was told that they had no room for her at the hotel and that there was nothing that they could for her and she needed to get a hold of HOTELS.COM. My employee called me and I immediately called HOTELS.COM. They asked me to hold and they would call the hotel. After being on hold for 15 minutes I put down the phone and called back.</p>
<p>I have used Hotels.com many times for personal and business and have not had any major issues with them up until today. They have lost a repeat and loyal customer for not only refusing to honor two free nights that expired on October 29th but for the lack of any compensation at all. They said they would help create a new personal account to start earning rewards again but there was absolutely nothing they could do to make up for the lost nights even though I did not know they expired. They tried to tell me they were improving their rewards system for future customers but did absolutely nothing to help their current (now former customer). In the hospitality line of work, I would expect a little more than an apology.</p>
<p>I have used Hotels.com many times prior to this review and never had any issues with their services. For some reason when I booked hotels for next June, 2019 the cancellation policy was misleading. I only book hotels with a free cancellation policy so to protect myself if I need to cancel a trip. This time, as I was going with several friends, I booked two rooms at two different hotels for them to choose which they liked the best. It turns out when I went to cancel one of the hotels (now 7 months in advance) I was told I would be penalized one night stay for each room booked.</p>
<p>I've called the customer service for Hotels.com a few times in The Netherlands and I always get the biggest morons on the phone who either provide me with the wrong information/wrong e-mail address to address an issue, don't have an answer and hang up the phone, tell me that they will fix the problem and I don't hear from them again, having fun with other colleagues while I'm calling about a complaint.</p>
<p>Beware of Hotels.com!!! I made 2 reservations - 1 disappeared and the 2nd had its date moved to the disappeared reservation's date! Guess who has to not only pay for wrong date but did not have a hotel room??? And no, they are not helping me try to get a refund!!! Yes, this kid! Please SHARE SHARE SHARE!</p>
<p>Created a booking using hotels.com mobile app. I used a discount code which they advertised for using their mobile app but nowhere during the booking process did they highlight that I would lose my rewards nights if I used the discount code. After making my booking I saw that the same was not added to my reward nights and called up customer care. Customer care told me that bookings with discount code would not be added to my reward nights. Highlighted to them that their useless app did not clearly mention this and they refused to budge. Offered to pay them the amount I saved due to the discount but still no solutions. Finally they offered me a compromise that they would only add two nights to my reward nights instead of the complete 4 nights that I booked. Asked me to contact customer care again once I returned from my trip.</p>
<p>Website defaulted back to ONE adult, I booked resort, upon reviewing my confirmation, I noticed it. I go back to website and see if it was my error, and nope it did it on its own. I call Hotels.com so there is no problem at resort and the person spoke broken English, so very hard to communicate, asked to speak with manager, same problem. Long story short, would not change my reservation unless I paid more money and then can't release my money that I just paid for 3 days, so now it holds up me booking with another company! I should have been given the price I was displayed, not my error about their website and they didn't offer any apology or discounted price... Never again will I book through them.</p>
<p>I’ve booked I thought was there. Expedia sent me to hotels.com, I booked a room in Kennesaw Georgia. They immediately took the payment from my card, room was great, when I checked out the next morning the hotel gave me a receipt which was less than what hotels.com charged me. Called hotels.com, told them what happened, they said, "Oh well. We’re not giving you a refund of the difference."</p>
<p>I usually do not write a review unless I have bad or wonderful experience. On 10 JUL 2018 during my vacation in Morocco. I reserved a rental apartment in Assilah for three days via HOTELS.COM and I got a message from HOTELS.COM stating "Your booking is guaranteed and all paid for". On our way to the Assilah the next day, I received a message from the property owner saying that due to a problem of overbooking, the apartment is not available for the 1st day of our three reserved days.</p>
<p>We just made reservations for 2 rooms on your Hotels.com at Marriott for $149 and the Hotels.com system booked us with Hampton Inn across town for $175. When we tried to make the correction we got nowhere with your Hotels.com customer service agent or the Hampton Inn hotel manager. Each blamed each other and no one took responsibility for the system error. We are getting stuck with huge inconvenience and a higher price. This is a huge rip-off!!!</p>
<p>Booked a room with them and my reservation was confirmed then cancelled by them 2 hours later. They said they couldn't verify my credit card. So I made the same reservation again with a different card. Received my confirmation again. 8 hours later they cancelled again with the same reason. I called my CC company who informed that there hadn't been any transactions made towards my account. Hotels.com's customer service is a joke if you can understand them. I have booked through these people many times in the past without any problems. Never again!</p>
<p>These people LIE. I booked through them to get rewards money and when I went to check on them, They said, "Sorry you don't exist." I stayed and returned home to check. I supplied the confirmation number and all the details FROM THEIR EMAILS TO ME. The girl Kath on chat said basically... "So sorry. BYE." I was booking another vaca and I am now retired. MANY more to come. WILL NEVER use them again.</p>
<p>Booked the same hotel going and coming from Bordentown, New Jersey. No problems with the first stay, booking worked and the hotel got paid. On the return trip, Hotels.com refused to pay the same hotel (both nights were the same price). We were told we couldn't keep the room unless we paid the hotel even though Hotels.com confirmed they received payment. The hotel reserve for bookings was $1.20 above the room price for both nights, but the second night Hotels.com refused to pay because the reserve was $1.20 more than the promised rate. Hotels.com said they would refund our money in 24 hours.</p>
<p>If you use the coupon code it makes the booking not count toward rewards program or toward collecting "free night". This was not anywhere on the main page when booking. I was one night away from getting silver member but now the 6 nights I booked with the coupon do not count so I will not be a silver member and none of those nights can be used towards the 10 nights to get a "free night".</p>
<p>Hotels.com booked flight, hotel, and ground round trip reservations for a trip to Pittsburgh, arriving 10/4. Ground transport was with Carmel Limousine. When we got to Pitt, I had an e-mail to contact Carmel. I was told they didn't have a vehicle available, and I needed to find my own ride. I ended up getting taxi service both ways, even though I had paid Hotels.com $121.60. I have been trying to get a refund for a month and continue to get the run-around from Hotels.com. I have spent hours on the phone, exchanged emails, and filed a dispute with my credit card provider, and am still trying to get a refund. I have learned that Hotels, Expedia, Priceline are under the same roof. None will get my business again. I strongly urge everyone to make travel plans thru the airlines, and absolutely avoid those companies I've cited.</p>
<p>I had to book a specific hotel in Costa Mesa for training approved and expensed by my employer. I called the number for the hotel and pressed option for reservation, was transferred to this service. Didn't realize I was using this service. Booked a refundable room on phone with corporate card. Got a text but did not receive email confirmation. When training was cancelled, I had to look up the credit card charge to cancel. After few transfers, reservation was cancelled but not a 14.99 service fee which was charged without telling me about it. All I was told was I was going to be charged a higher refundable rate. Their rate was NO cheaper than the hotel's own rate AND they blindsighted me with a NON refundable service fee. Awful customer service.</p>
<p>This site is a fraud. I have been a member for over 2 years earning my rewards for the free night after 10 stays. I get to number 9 and they magically don’t give me my 10 so I can get my reward because they say I didn’t log in under my account but I can show them my credit card bill that shows it was billed to hotels.com. Needless to say it’s been 9 months and they have zeroed my account and now say I can’t get the credit for that stay even though I have the proof. Typical crap with rewards companies not doing what they say. So much for this BS site. I will not be using it in the future and I recommend using another site. Not worth your money or time.</p>
<p>Beware of this booking agency. I had two accounts and they refused to merge them which cost me well over 10 night stays with them. I had been a customer for over 5 years. They refused. I will never book with this company again. Zero customer service or a reasonable resolution. Never again!</p>
<p>At 5:00 a.m. on October 10, we had to pack up and run from Panama City Beach as Hurricane Michael was changed from an expected Category 2 to a Cat 4 - plus hurricane. There were no hotels anywhere to be found by then. We phoned Hotels.com and had a reservation within 2 minutes less than an hour from our location on the road that was out of the path of the hurricane. It was a lovely hotel at a reasonable price, nearly filled with other evacuees. We had passed hotel after hotel, all of which were full. We didn't think we'd find anything until we called. We are so grateful for Hotels.com's speed, kindness and resourcefulness under trying circumstances. So many blessings have occurred in our area since Hurricane Michael hit, the first of which was Hotels.com! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
<p>Room not as expected. En suite had black mould in and around shower tray and silicone sealant. Outside of shower cubicle damaged and had been poorly repaired. Towel rail hanging off the wall, holes not filled where toilet roll holder had previously been located. Door to en suite cracked and poorly repaired. One bath towel for two guests. Grubby carpet. Window frames black at edges. Website claimed “free parking”. Not true. Nearest parking was five minutes away in public car park and had to be paid for after 08.00 the following day.</p>
<p>I booked my first VIP Gold members only property deal (marked by a Gold and VIP symbol online when browsing) and received no perks aside from online price matching with another site. No early check-in, room upgrade, free breakfast or late checkout, etc. None of the standard perks you would expect from common hotel reward programs. Because this was my first gold status booking I called Hotels.com customer support to help me step by step with my reservation, making sure it's done right with perks included. However, once I was at the hotel I found out that the Hotels.com agent booked a standard reservation with no benefits.</p>
<p>Long time user. This site is high on rewards--low on rewards being meaningful. My rewards expired under the radar proving useless. Trips booked on an account using the same email address of the new account and credit card info cannot be credited after the fact. Customer service is overseas and the call center is unfamiliar with basic use of English language.</p>
<p>You will do better to book directly with the hotel, both in terms of price and service. When I have had problems with the booking, the Hotels.com staff have been of no help at all. Also, if you use a coupon code, the nights you book will not count to your status nor toward earning "free" nights. That was news to me as this was not mentioned anywhere on the page where I booked my hotels or on my receipt. The staff when I did call were rude, combative, and poorly trained. I travel a great deal. This is not a service I will ever use again.</p>
<p>If I could give this company 0 stars I would. First, they didn't advise me that they were a third party booking company when I made the reservation. I never received confirmation of my reservation via email. Ultimately I needed to cancel my reservation. Only at this time was I informed by the hotel itself that the reservation was through a third party (hotels.com). When I attempted to cancel online, I was not permitted to do so. I was first informed my reservation was through Expedia (I only learned after I booked that Expedia is a partner company). After calling Expedia they informed me my booking was through hotels.com. I contacted hotels.com by phone and they canceled the reservation and again informed me I would receive a confirmation email of my cancellation. I never received such email. </p>
<p>Do not book a hotel with this company. They are crooks!!! I made a reservation and by mistake it was the wrong location so I called to change it within five minutes of making the mistake and they stated it would be fine and I’d get a callback from someone within one hour and confirmed my phone number. After that I carried on about my day and never got the call. The next day was Sunday so I thought I’d wait 'til Monday since it wasn’t a business day. Today (Monday) I called them and they said they didn’t call me back because they didn’t have a good number. I confirmed my number again and was told again that they’d call back in an hour. Several hours later I called back and they again said they’d call me back in an hour. After that I was skeptical and called and spoke to a manager who literally promises me an urgent callback after several apologies. </p>
<p>So, lesson learnt - I will never make a booking with hotels.com again. Booked a twin room, got 2 beds in four bedroom. Of course, when you contact them they say that is what I booked. I know what I booked! I checked the information very carefully before making the reservation. Yes, the price was very good but that is not the way you do the business if you want to keep your clients.</p>
<p>Was one stay short of receiving a free night and they cancelled. The company customer service is very very poor. I saw the review on 10/26/18 by Joy of Southborough, MA, and they experienced the same that I did. In trying to work with the chat person, I experienced the excuse there is nothing they can do, and when requesting cancellation of account and personal info, they could not do that either. The chat person finally said they deleted the account, but left the impression they just wanted to end the chat. I would not recommend them to anyone.</p>
<p>I spoke with 6 representatives in reservation and customer service department for Hotels.com. I was hung up and twice And I was told that if I wanted to use my rewards points I would have to pay the $10 a night additional fee because of the cancelation policy. Apparently being able to cancel a reservation will cost you. If you don't need to cancel a reservation you will get a discount. I'm booking for tomorrow night. I don't plan on canceling so why can't I get the $10 less a night price and use my rewards. "I'm sorry ma'am. It doesn't work that way." That's a rip off! Why bother collecting nights to get a free night if you have to pay more money for the Room just to get it for free.</p>
<p>Contacted Hotels.com to obtain a no show confirmation for a hotel booking through them to help with a travel insurance claim due to an accident I suffered but they were not interested in assisting with my request. Happy to take my money but not interested in helping. I will not use their services again.</p>
<p>Beware of this site. They promise a free night after booking 10 nights but fail to mention that their rewards expire. When I called about it, they said there is nothing they can do and the Manager's boss doesn't take calls. Apparently he knows they suck so and probably doesn't give two cents.</p>
<p>Today 10/26/18 I called because I just had a 3 night stay and did not collect any rewards. The customer service had 2 different reasons why which did not make any sense. First reason was that when I booked I did not book through my membership. That's a lie cause when I did book I took a screenshot and it clearly shows my membership number included. Then after she realized that was a lie she comes up with a different story and says that I didn't collect any nights because I used a coupon. First off that makes no sense if that's truly Hotels.com policy because I have used a coupon before on the mobile app and I still collected nights. Second I have a screenshot of the price after I entered in my coupon and it said I would collect 3 nights with this stay! </p>
<p>Booked a hotel in Germany, got a confirmation and then the next day it was canceled. Hotels.com said it was a credit card problem so they couldn't comment on it. Called my credit card company, they said they hadn't had any bookings show up or any concerns raised. Re-booked again, same thing happened again. Interesting that the initial rate is no longer available nor is the room. Bait and Switch me thinks? Can't be sure, but it sure smells like that. Just deleted the Hotels.com app from my phone and will be doing the same thing with Expedia.com (parent company).</p>
<p>Package booking is a joke. Beware if you book a flight + hotel package via hotels.com. Even if you logged into your account to book it, at the end you will not be able to see your booking under your account. Nothing will show up on your dashboard except that you only get a single email. Moreover, Rewards cannot be applied to package bookings. I had to call the customer service to clarify everything and they didn't really care.</p>
<p>I’ve been booking with Hotels.com for quite some time now vs. other hotel websites. This one gave me the lowest price or the same price and the only difference is that it lets you know which hotel you are booking this hotel at. Customer service is easy to work with too and I want to give Stephen or Steven a shout-out for being efficient and helpful. Hotel we stayed at was University Square Hotel in Fresno, CA.</p>
<p>I booked a 2 night stay in Colorado Springs through Hotels.com and once I checked in found out that I paid DOUBLE through Hotels.com than if I would have just paid at the hotel. When I called customer service and talked to a supervisor I asked for a price match and they basically told me too bad and would not work with me at all. I promise this is the last time I use this ripoff site.</p>
<p>I booked this hotel through Hotels.com. I cancelled the room a week prior to the book date. The hotel charged my credit card anyway. Neither Hotels.com or the Embassy Suite would agree on who was at fault and did not reimburse my credit card. They blamed each other. This is a Hilton establishment?? Please beware of The Embassy Suites Washington DC’s management practices along with Hotels.com!! Red Roof Inn provides better service and customer satisfaction. I’ll update this post when someone decides to reimburse my credit for their mistake. Beware!</p>
<p>I found out the hard way that Hotels.com outsources a lot of their business through 3rd part suppliers, which can be alarming when you don't know the name of the company you are actually dealing with. This is probably ok when things go well, but a disaster when you have a problem. I made a group booking through the Hotels.com website and even though everything looked like it was from Hotels.com, including receipts, it was actually a 3rd party supplier called Hotelplanner.com. </p>
<p>Yes, I could read that the reservation had a "no cancellation" policy once booked. But, seriously, I canceled within 5 minutes of making the reservation and paying because I learned my trip was canceled! Nope, sorry, Hotels.com is going to go ahead and keep that $459 for the Four Seasons. Pretty disgusting that they won't work with a loyal patron and refund the money to re-book for another date. Won't be a patron now!</p>
<p>I booked a hotel with Hotels.com. I chose to pay at the hotel. I found a lower price. I contacted Hotels.com. Was asked to email a screenshot. I did. I received an email back confirming the lower price. I was told in the email that 72 hours after check out the refund would be processed. It could take 7-10 days to receive it back which is understandable. It has now turn into a cluster. I’m either told, "Oh we didn’t get the email" which I have the confirmation email confirming the lower price from them. Then told, "You need to contact the hotel directly for the refund." I’m not sure why the price wasn’t changed prior to arriving. I could have and should have canceled my reservation with Hotels.com and booked it with Trivago. I have definitely learned a lesson. Hotels.com has lost my business. For the next person. Cancel and rebook. Not worth the hassle.</p>
<p>I am very disappointed with Hotels.com. I had booked a stay for 2 nights to Boston through the website with free cancellation or change as I have done in the past. When I booked this room it mentioned nothing about minimum stays needed. Today when I called to cancel one of the nights because our plans changed I am told they have to check availability which confused me since I already had a room just needed to cancel one night. They then tell me I have to cancel my current room since I am not staying the 2 nights and rebook it for the current rate even though this was not indicated when I booked the room. </p>
<p>We were traveling to Bisbee AZ for my husband's job. We booked a hotel the first night we were there and was using VRBO for the rest of the week. We initially were going to drive back on Friday but thought it would be nice to stay in Tombstone Friday then return Saturday. I went to make the reservation at Tombstone Monumental Guest Ranch. While making the reservation Hotels.com had a pop up come up on the site that was offering a much lower price for our stay. Of course I clicked on that and proceeded with the reservation.</p>
<p>My wife and I began our 40th wedding anniversary trip with Ireland. Unfortunately, due a bad weather our plane was redirected to Belgium for several hours before returning to Dublin. When we arrived we were notified our initial lodging -- booked privately -- had been canceled as they did not anticipate flights coming in that night (that's a different story). When arriving in Dublin we went online and found a room through Hotels.com at the Hilton downtown. After spending all day traveling and 50 Euro on a taxi there we were informed when we arrived that we and about 20 other people had been overbooked and no rooms were to be found. It was 20:30 at this point; the Hilton indicated they had notified Hotels.com they were full 3 1/2 hour earlier. I contacted Hotels.com customer service line and attempted to work with them to find another room -- any room so that my wife and I could get some much needed sleep after our long day of travel. </p>
<p>OK so this is partially a complaint against Hotels.com, but also against the Sonesta ES chain. 2 hours before check-in I get a text from Hotels.com that my "booking is guaranteed and all paid for." Booking was cancelled by Sonesta ES in Princeton NJ because they overbooked! So they put me in another hotel for the same price, which I come to find out the room is cheaper (overpaid but they never told me) and it also only includes breakfast for 2 (we had 4) so now I also had to pay additional for 2 meals. After dealing with Hotels.com for over an hour, they tell me the new booking was more expensive than their app lists because it was a last minute booking (no fault of mine). Eventually they offer me a $50 coupon, which still doesnt cover the additional amount I ended up paying. I am close to getting my 10th night free, so once I do I am pretty much done with this website. They truly don't value the customer. I am disgusted by this whole thing.</p>
<p>Booked hotel in Boston Oct 6-8, 2018, to take my daughter for her 16 BD mini get-away. We arrived Boston downtown right away to start the activities. Around 11 pm I called the hotel to confirm our arrival to find out they are overbooked and they do not have room for us. Called Hotels.com to find out what is going on. We spent next 3 hrs on the phone with customer service representatives somewhere in Bangladesh or Mumbai who were not able to provide any solutions to the problem Hotels.com created. </p>
<p>Reserve a room at the Element Hotel at Frankfurt Airport. The booking confirms an airport shuttle. When I called the hotel, they did not answer the phone. After 4 attempts I called Hotels.com at the number given in the hotel booking confirmation, but received a message that the call could not be completed. Took a taxi and was told the phones weren't working at the hotel, yet they received 2 calls while I was at the desk. Next morning asked for a shuttle to the airport and told they didn't have any. Wrote a review at hotels.com, explaining the poor service and misrepresentation. Got an email from Hotels.com saying they couldn't post because it violated one of their policies. I wrote the review again and submitted, followed by an error message. Obviously Hotels.com doesn't care to hear about negative experiences or publish. Very strange.</p>
<p>First...and last time I use Hotels.com. Made a reservation for 4 in the Kansas City area two weeks prior. Like most, I base my selections on amenities and quality of establishment. Upon arriving at the hotel, I was informed that they were under construction and remodel, the mini fridge was removed from the room, and the pool was out of commission. I found disappointment in the fact that neither the hotel or Hotels.com made any attempt in reporting this prior to arrival--it would have saved us from the next two miserable hours. A simple email or phone call would suffice. Nowhere on the hotel website or Hotels.com did it mention the ongoing construction. The hotel gambles with whether a guest will be disappointed or not. </p>
<p>I recently booked Neopolitan Bed and Breakfast in Naples, Italy with Hotel.com. I did not stay as I became ill and returned to the US. Three times I requested Hotel.com CS contact B&amp;B and cancel my stay. I was asked to call back tomorrow and speak to management. When there is a 9 hr time zone difference CS should contact management direct. They did not.</p>
<p>Hotels.com has awarded me a free night and then taken it back months after my stay on over two occasions. I have been trying to get it fixed for a year and a half. Customer service does not ever resolve and it takes months of back and forth with many messages going unanswered. You are forced to contact them via messenger but they (or a computer) do not always reply. The excuse for taking the free night back is always "the hotel said you canceled." How does one cancel a reservation months AFTER they stayed? Better yet, I have called the hotel myself and they confirm my stay in both instances. I was asked to provide my receipt which I have done on multiple occasions. No one replies. I have questioned if it was received multiple times and not a word has been returned. Ok used and Loved this app for years but it is awful now. I will not use this service again.</p>
<p>I reserved two hotel rooms at a hotel in Madrid and for one of the rooms accidentally clicked on the wrong type of room. I immediately realized my error and clicked on a link that said Change next to the room. That removed the room from my reservation and I was able to reserve the correct room. However, Hotels.com charged me for the room I cancelled because they said it was a non-refundable rate. I called and explained what had happened, that the cancellation was a change, not a cancellation, but they told me the reservation had already been sent through to the hotel so it was the hotel's decision as to whether I would receive a refund. They supposedly contacted the hotel and then informed me the hotel would not give me the refund. </p>
<p>Bad cancelation policy. Could not cancel a reservation without a full price penalty. The best they would do was give me an $80.00 credit. I will never use them again! The people I talked to could barely speak English also.</p>
<p>Booked a flight through Hotels.com, the airline canceled it the next day so last minute I booked directly with the airlines, thank God there was still a flight available. The problem is Hotels.com already charged my card and took my money. Spent over 3 hours on the phone trying to get a refund to be told it will take 8-12 weeks to get my money back, that the airlines has to send it, even though my card says it was paid to Hotels.com. Asked for a supervisor or someone who could explain this a little better why it's going to take so long and there was not one available. </p>
<p>This website is a joke, don't reserve rooms from this place. I was charge over 153 dollars in the website, when I arrived at the Discovery Inn Napa hotel the rate was lower than the one posted on Hotels.com, it was 126.20. When I called Hotels.com to let them know what a rip off the website is, the male who answer the phone said that they have to get a commission for booking the hotel. So basically there's a 25 dollar fee. Just go to EXPEDIA.COM. Better offers with no hidden fees.</p>
<p>I found a hotel on Hotels.com. I went to make reservations and I was asked if I wanted to add a flight, so I did, and was given a discount for bundling. I was interrupted, so logged back on a few hours later in the same day and logged in the flights and then added the hotel again, and I was charged $60 more a night for the hotel and there was no savings for bundling. I cleared that out and went to search just for the hotel and the room was back to the original cost! I reserved the hotel room and then went back in to see what was offered for the flights separately. They were the same price, so I loaded all the information in for the travelers going and hit the process button, and was told the flight costs went up $30 each and the flights I originally wanted were no longer available! </p>
<p>I booked online 2 weeks prior to my 2 nights stay at hotel in Wisconsin for my daughter's wedding for September 21st-23rd, was charged $322.32 from Hotels.com online. Once I checked out of hotel I stayed at I was asked by manager of hotel if I wanted a receipt. I said, "Of course," and seen hotel I stayed at only charged $264.29, taxes included. I asked why hotel receipt was cheaper than hotels.com charged me through online booking, manager at hotel said she didn't know why.  Manager of hotel said never go through any online booking through Hotels.com or any other online hotel booking sites, they always uncharge and make money off their customers. </p>
<p>Pls be careful. This site is take your money and they are not applying to refund to you for any case. I lost $600. My story: I was travel to BALI and booking from them Avalon Ubud Villas. Owner contact me after few hrs of booking tell me there no available Villa. I told him to contact to HOTELS.com. He contact them and they say will solve this issue. I wait a long time before going to my travel. Nobody response. I email them. Nobody answer. The owner was helpful, from 07/2018 till now no answer. No money. My Advice: I have long time experience of booking travel, don't waste your time &amp; money. They have FAKE promotion and contact information.</p>
<p>I was booking late for the night of during a long drive with our family. I had booked numerous times through Hotels.com in the past, just never that late in the evening. The calendar had the date highlighted, which it always had the past as the day of. I booked 2 rooms and arrived to be told the booking was for the next night. I immediately attempted to book a room so that we could have a place to stay and it only allowed the following day despite it still not being after midnight. Hotels.com refused to refund the money stating I chose the date of the stay. I attempted to explain that their website had auto-filled the next date and had always filled with the day of... they continued to explain that I chose the date. I will not be using the website in the future due to the horrible customer service.</p>
<p>My husband and I were on a 3 week tour of France, when not staying with friends, we booked our accommodation through Hotels.com. On two occasions our reservations were messed up. The first was inconsequential - We had booked Hotel Le Verger in Saint-Laurent-Nouan, which turned out to be in the middle of nowhere, but that was fine by us. So although they didn't have a booking for us, they had a room.</p>
<p>Trying to cancel a reservation in Wilmington NC due to the flooding. Will not until hotel can be notified. Hotel is closed due to the flooding! Totally moronic! Not helpful, can hardly understand them, recommend dealing with hotel directly, also non-refundable which I didn't realize until I received the confirmation email. Called Choice directly and the reservation wasn't even inputted correctly!</p>
<p>We had booked a Fully refundable trip, Had to cancel the trip due to family emergency. Hotels.com did not refund our money and claimed the Hotel was non refundable. When I tried to contact Hotels.com I got someone in Philippines who had no idea what I am talking about. These guys are Fraud.</p>
<p>I canceled my trip after talking with customer care (thrice) and I was confirmed that I will get full refund because I had taken package protection plan. To be noted, they knew about my airlines and hotels, but now they refused to refund me any money. Horrible website and their own representatives are saying that previous one had provided inaccurate information. I have recordings from each conversation to prove my point.</p>
<p>Booked a room in New Orleans for three nights thru Hotels.com. Well, I missed my flight and had to catch the next one the next morning. I called Hotels.com to make sure I wouldn't lose my room because I didn't check in on my arrival date - the entire stay was already paid for, and I let them know that I was more than willing to pay for the first night I missed. They contacted the hotel for me to confirm that I still had my reservation. Then, they refunded the first nite's room, even though I changed the reservation on the day I was supposed to arrive. Very surprising!</p>
<p>I booked a town home for 2 nights thru Hotels.com for $452.00 with ACO-Encore Resort in Kissimmee FL from Sept 14-16, 2018. Upon arrival, I find out by the guard at the gate that there isn't a check-in office and I would have to deal with ACO before gaining entry onto the property. I received the rental contract from ACO which states that in order to validate the rental, I would have to email them a copy of my driver's license and CREDIT CARD. I refused to email a copy of my credit card and called Hotels.com customer service twice, both times I was told by a representative and a supervisor that nothing could be done about it and I was going to lose my entire rental fee. I was forced to find other accommodations during hurricane Florence evacuations. I wasn't told prior to booking the property that there isn't a check-in office and would have to email my credit card to a stranger. Furthermore, I wasn't given a solution or any alternative by Hotels.com.</p>
<p>I cancelled with Hotels.com in the appropriate window but was still charged for a night's stay. They never cancelled my reservation with the hotel. They refused to help in any way. They kept telling me the hotel cancelled according to policy even though Hotels.com was in the wrong.</p>
<p>I booked 4 oceanfront rooms with them back in March 2018 for the month of September, they told me only $336 would be taken out of my acct and they took the entire $2200. I called and they stated it was a new hire and she made a mistake, they take all upfront. We get to the hotel and guess what, no oceanfront rooms, they booked us a studio (1 rm w/ bathroom &amp; 1 window, side view). I go back downstairs and check with check in and told them they made a mistake. They tell me Hotels.com cannot book ocean front because of the Diamond Resort policy. </p>
<p>They will charge your Visa even without your permission. You won't be charged until you check in at hotel is a lie. Once that money is out it's over. Even if you want to cancel within 24 hour there is no refund. Their policy is lie. Their advertisement is a lie. Their prices are lies. NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN!</p>
<p>We booked 2 different hotel stays through Hotels.com, we booked early in May and had both trips paid for in June. When we traveled 8-23-18 to 9-2-18 we got charged again for each hotel stay by the hotels! And it has been a nightmare trying to get refunds and the staff with Hotels.com shouldn't have jobs in customer service because they are rude, uncaring and useless with NO help whatsoever! We are still trying to resolve issues and I tell everyone I know, "NEVER use this service because you will get ripped off and no one will help you!" My husband just asked a lady today from Hotels.com if she cares about what was going on and that we were upset and she said nothing! These are bad people!</p>
<p>I saw a rate of $108 on Hotels.com and a rate of $96 on the original hotel website. I typically would have just booked through the hotel, however, I had a gift card so I read the price guarantee and everything looked perfect. I was declined once asking for more information and they also the hotel website was now higher. I went back to the hotel website took another screenshot and gave another link for the reservation and the price was still $96. There was also a lower price for a different room which was $88. That was the only prices on the website. They again came back saying it was denied and the price reflected higher on the hotel website. Which I think is funny that they ask me what the price shows on the website but they don't tell what the higher price they saw on the website. I feel the price guarantee is a complete LIE.</p>
<p>I am not happy at all with the overpriced room I got from Hotels.com. The price at the hotel was far cheaper 1200 peso $66 usd at current exchange rate. Plus the hotel was barely worth what the hotel was charging. They had only warmish water - not hot water and The jacuzzi tub was broken. It was pretty dumpy for the almost $100 I paid. The hotel should have been a lot nicer. I didn't get a deal with hotels.com at all - I GOT RIPPED OFF!</p>
<p>Booked a room through this site that “guaranteed” lowest prices. After selecting the number of guest and dates, they show a list of hotels and prices. Once a hotel is selected and dates confirmed, the prices jump up tremendously for every day other than the first day. To make matters worse, the amount you pay them isn’t the complete amount. There are added charges imposed at the hotel upon checking out for “resort fees” and other taxes upon taxes. So their claim of lowest price is just a scam to get you on their site.</p>
<p>Firstly, I never write reviews (good or bad... yes, I'm lazy). So, for me to sit here and write this should be fair warning for this company. Hotels.com never gave me my points for 2 rooms (6 nights) per room (12 points). I called "Sunshine" who forwarded me to Tracy, then to Max (supervisor) back to Sunshine and finally Nathan. At this point, I have a headache as they are all unhelpful SOBs. Prior to my flight, I couldn't find the itinerary and called hotels.com and they couldn't find it either. Finally, after too much effort they found it. Apparently, their package department is different from their hotel's dept. (Ok fine).</p>
<p>So I accidentally booked a non-refundable hotel room in Hong Kong for December 2018 (currently right now it is still August 2018). Upon creating this error I immediately reached out to Hotels.com to see if I can correct my error and have them cancel the reservation and refund the charge. The 1st time I called I spoke to representative that told me that reservation has not shown up at the hotel's booking yet, but she would help me send an email requesting to cancel and refund the charge because it was made in error. </p>
<p>Worst hotel booking experience ever. Hotels.com is fine with scamming their customers. Booked a reservation through Hotels.com for a stay in an apartment. Was given multiple DIFFERENT addresses of the apartment. Was unable to contact the hotel/apartment rental company over a period of MONTHS to ask questions about the address and the late check-in process. Tried various methods of contact including email and phone number contact information provided by Hotels.com. Called Hotels.com customer service 6 or 7 times to try to get the issue resolved and each time was given incorrect information and was lied to. </p>
<p>Collector beware. I had 7 collected nights stay. Booked 2 more nights and was informed I needed 1 more night stay to be eligible for my free night. Unfortunately I was a couple weeks late of booking in the year time frame. Not months, weeks. When booking for my 10th night stay I was informed all my collected stays had vanished. POOF. They were all gone because they have a year to book policy. Sometimes rules can be bent when it comes to customer satisfaction. They do not value their loyal customers. SO SAD.</p>
<p>Hotels.com is the worst web portal for booking. We have been using other websites and never had an issue. We booked a non-refundable room via Hotels.com but accidentally entered wrong dates. I had a scheduled surgery so it was impossible for us to reschedule our plans. When we realized it in 4 MINUTES we reached out to Hotels.com. We explained our situation. Asked for a change in our reservation dates since a humane mistake had happened. We were informed to wait 72 hours to hear back from the management of the hotel. We haven't heard back from them and we called the Hotels.com customer service and the Chrome Montreal Centre-Ville many times. Neither hotel's management nor Hotels.com did anything about it but the frustrating part is when we talked with someone from the reception, she said that this happens to SO MANY people! </p>
<p>The worst. Never again. Do not do business with Hotels.com. They either don't know or tell you whatever they think you want to hear. They just take your money quickly and leave you hanging. They told us hot tub, no tub. They told us free breakfast, not so. They told us view of river, NO. They did not tell us about parking charge. They gave us very poor directions, got lost. Had to call hotel. Not close to any restaurants, like they said would be. Why are they still in business? DO NOT do business with them for any reason. They are NOT the cheapest.</p>
<p>Booked Hotel Bally’s in Las Vegas in August 2018 thru Hotels.com. Reservation mentioned continental breakfast for 2 and free WiFi. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were given a voucher of $18/day to use in a coffee shop (there was no continental breakfast!). 18$ bought me 4 cups of coffee! Sent 2 emails and called hotels.com - no response at all. I don’t blame Bally’s but I do blame hotels.com for incorrectly mentioning that continental breakfast was included. Also WiFi was free, but only for 2 devices. For extra device there was a charge of 15$/day- once again misleading words from hotels.com. Are there no laws they can stop such malpractice from such a website as hotels.com? Be aware travelers!</p>
<p>June we booked a hotel in the middle of the desert on the way through Moses Lake, WA on a long road trip. All of the hotel information was incorrect INCLUDING THE PICTURES. Had to go through MY BANK to get a refund even though it was false advertising. Second time, was looking for another family room (we never travel without the kids) and called the day before the reservation because they booked us a single bedroom and would offer no help fixing our reservation even when I offered to pay full price at another hotel with two rooms.</p>
<p>Hotels.com uses such a convoluted system that it seems impossible to book a room and use the free night earned through their rewards program. It seems more like a scam than anything else. I tried to be vigilant about booking only through Hotels.com whenever possible, but my efforts seemed to have been a waste of my time.</p>
<p>I see some very negative reviews of Hotels.com here. In my experience, they often do a better job than going to the hotel's website. Reasons to use Hotels.com. They often are cheaper (even when the hotel says it "guarantees the best deal") and the website faster. Much easier to compare amenities and prices. They actually disclose all the fees, which some hotels keep hidden until after you make the reservation (I'm talking about you, Affinia). They make the cancellation time restrictions very clear (again, many hotels make this difficult). You get a (complicated, but real) 10% discount if you use hotels.com regularly. This is above often getting a better price than the hotel's website. The only time I have had a negative experience was when I made a reservation 10 minutes before showing up at the hotel, and I had to sit on my heels for 30 minutes while the check-in staff found the reservation.</p>
<p>Will never, ever book with Hotels.com again. Upon arriving at the Baymont by Wyndham Wisconsin Dells, we discovered that there was an issue with each room. We booked for 3 suites. Only one room was a suite. This was only the beginning of our issues. That room only had power running to 1/2 of it. The second room had an issue with the A/C and a burning wire smell, which set off the smoke alarm. The entire room smelled. Not to mention it was filthy. After arguing, he moved us to a room even smaller and we couldn’t fit all of our children in the room with only two beds. My 7 year old found a PILL in the chair. The third room was filthy. Sticky stuff all over the walls. Stained sheets. Mold. And moldy/musty smelling towels.</p>
<p>A property represented by Hotels.com the Jeddore Lodge and Cabins in Head of Jeddore near Halifax, was rude and belligerent when we told her the cabin did not deliver on the amenities listed. As a govt and military family we are professional and above reproach character and integrity. The owner got angry, threatened and we left the property. So we were not able to complete our stay because of her attitude and actions. Contacted hotels.com for support. They have refused to give us reward nights we lost because of her actions. Hotels.com represent her, so they are responsible for what happened. We lost our nights and now they won't give them to us. We have used them extensively, and one would think they would want to keep us booking with them by doing the honorable thing and restoring our nights. </p>
<p>I made two booking for the same "hotel" in Madrid, one for the night before my flight and another one a month later for two nights. I made sure I checked all accommodation types except hostels and then selected Abracadabra Suites in Madrid. I read plenty of good reviews and didn't see any bad ones. In the key facts about the property it said a among other facts: Key facts This hotel is arranged over 1 floor. Arriving/leaving. Check-in time 3 PM-midnight.</p>
<p>I should have read the reviews, no problem taking your money but when there is a refund due they just KEEP giving me the runaround. I called 5 different times, each time everything will be handled. Never a return response. Nothing has happened to help with refund due. Sent all information 3 separate times??? Still nothing. DON'T USE HOTELS.COM!!!</p>
<p>I booked a hotel through Hotels.com and was angry when I found out that they charged, what I assume was a booking fee, that turned out to be about 17% of the cost of our hotel room rate. I was not informed by Hotels.com what the fees were. I only found out the total cost when my credit card was charged. It was after backing out the state and local taxes that I found out. As far as their "stay 10 times and get a free night" promo, you might better save the booking fees and buy your 10th night.</p>
<p>I have just paid a deposit for next year in April. The emails are now coming back from Hotels.com India. Have they been taken over? I decided to look at reviews and the ones from this month certainly sound like the company is dodgy. I think I might cancel on that basis, but will I get my deposit back? I will email the hotel to see if there is a booking. I have used them without a hitch on my last 3 overseas trip and never had a problem. I tried to claim my rewards night and was told I could only do that by paying the next booking in full at the time.</p>
<p>I booked 2 rooms from Hotel Lindenhof from Austria for a night. Hotel said it has no any agreement with Hotel.com and there is not any reservation, And refused us host. We could not stay there. However the hotel charged and got the money from my credit card. I report that to hotel.com five times times asking to solve this problem. Unfortunately Hotels.com records the complaint but do not solve nor gives feedback to me since more than 40 days. We trusted in Hotels.com to book Hotels but it is indifferent to problems. I ask to Hotels.com to prove that it is a trustable firm by solving this problem.</p>
<p>I booked through Hotels.com for 13 nights and only to find out when I checked out &amp; saw my final invoice from the hotel, I paid almost $800 more with Hotels.com. Hotels.com won’t honor it plus, the promo that they have for free hotel nights, that’s a trick. They’ll trick you to apply the promo code &amp; that would be their excuse not to give the rewards night.</p>
<p>I reserved 10 nights in a hotel overseas under the policy and at the rate that I allowed to cancel or change the reservation within 72 hours after reservation. I called within 24 hours to change the reservation. They first stated I had passed the deadline. After complaining and being transferred to the complaint department, the Manager, Stephanie **, changed the story, and now stated there was no cancellation or change policy and that I could not be refunded in any way, or change my reservation. I asked for their email address so that I could send them the email booking confirmation I had received that proved there was a 72h change and cancellation policy, but they said there was no way to send them any emails. </p>
<p>Booked and paid for 3 week rental for my crew. Crew showed up and found not only was someone else renting the condo but at least 3 other parties were booked there, in error, as well. Condo personnel said they called Hotels.com when the prior parties arrived and was told Hotels.com had notified everyone and all was okay. Hotels.com kept me on the phone for over 90 minutes then said they couldn't find us a place to stay, oh well. They said I could not have the $7200 I prepaid back for at least 7-10 days even though it was needed to find another place for my crew. </p>
<p>Second call - Hotels.com claims that the hotel denied the refund again. </p>
<p>I booked a business trip and needed to cancel it. The hotel agreed to cancel the reservation but Hotels.com refused to refund my reservation blaming the hotel. I called the hotel directly 3x and each time they advised they will cancel the reservation with NO fee/charges. Hotels.com said they will not refund our account per hotel policy. Will never use Hotels.com for our company reservations any longer.</p>
<p>I have used this company for over 6 months now, and it is now coming to an end. I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars in their so called "rewards" program. They constantly are manipulating the prices of the accommodations based on how full the hotel is. You can't plan a budget like this or allocate your money because one day the room could be $60 and the next double that price due to price manipulation! It is a scam, and I have written many reviews about the shoddy properties they advertise on their site. I have found Hotels.com routinely not posting my negative reviews and hiding them to prop up the hotels they advertise in order for the hotel to keep making money and them too bilking the customer and leading them on. THIS IS OUTRIGHT DISHONESTY AND SILENCING THE VOICES OF THOSE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF! </p>
<p>I converted my Tesco Clubcard vouchers to £450 worth of Hotels.com vouchers. At the checkout the discount cam off (so the code worked). However, when I tried to complete the transaction it gives a constant error code. Tesco have been trying to contact them for 4 days. I am unable as there’s no email address, technical help, etc. Only a booking line based on India. 2 different managers said they could do nothing and questioned whether I had money in the bank! Said the hotels were full, etc., etc. but could do nothing. Direct me nowhere and one slammed the phone down! Never again would I use them. I now have a trip booked and will have to book and pay for the hotel myself and have £450 of unusable vouchers. I highly recommend Booking.com. Try them!</p>
<p>I went to Bolivia and Chile 3 months ago and I request invoice with company name from Hotels.com. It has been 3 months, they did not provide it yet. I sent a lot of emails to them. I don't think that they are operating legally. It is the worst service quality I got from any traveling websites. I will never use it again.</p>
<p>I booked a room in Las Vegas. Fee was $233. Showed up and the hotel would not accept the booking and turned us away. Said they would refund the booking to Hotels.com. Booked a very expensive replacement hotel and called Hotels.com to obtain the refund. They claim we cannot get the refund because it was too late in spite of the fact that the reservation was made about an hour earlier and the hotel said they were refunding the booking. Hotels.com took our money and presumably the hotel’s refund. Thieves.</p>
<p>I made a reservation in Florence, Italy in June for a vacation planned in December. The cancellation policy stated: "Free cancellation until 12/23/18". My husband was just diagnosed with a serious illness and we needed to cancel our trip. I tried to cancel online and was informed that it was a special discounted rate that was non-refundable.</p>
<p>I booked a trip to Las Vegas at Vdara for Saturday August 11, 2018, checking out on Thursday August 16th, 2018. I used the drop down calendar on Hotels.com site. For some reason, the reservation booked for Thursday July 26, 2018 to Monday July 30th, 2018. I learned of this by way of an email, asking me how my check in was at Vdara on 7/26.</p>
<p>I booked a hotel at Norwood in on Hotels.com. When I got to the hotel there were 30 upset people in the lobby because the rooms wasn't cleaned yet at 5 o'clock and people were getting turned away that had reservations. I tried checking in and I was told I wasn't guaranteed a room even though I prepaid. She said we could wait and see. It was 9pm when I was offered a room. Very stressful situation.</p>
<p>When making reservations, clearly stated “Pay at hotel” except when I made the reservation was charged immediately. Then when needed to make a change well within the allowable time frame, was told had to cancel then rebook at almost double the rate! DO NOT BOOK THROUGH HOTELS.COM! I have used other booking sites as well as directly with hotels with no problems. I will NEVER use them again and will find every place that I can to place a bad review.</p>
<p>Hotels.com seems to be very deficient on the number of hotels offering 'redeem rewards' possibilities. On several occasions I specifically looked for hotels to use my rewards points and found that ENTIRE CITIES had no entries! Plenty of places to collect reward points, but no place to use them. This is bogus.</p>
<p>It's a bait and switch type of situation with Hotels.com! They lure you with email or ads and the price is not the same in the end! It changes minute to minute... I am done using sites! I call hotel direct now!!</p>
<p>I entered my parameters for a hotel stay (the date, number of guests, and location). The site booked me 45 minutes away in another state. As soon as the pages popped up, I called to have them rectify the mistake. The customer service agent hemmed and hawed and kept putting me in home. The upshot was that after half an hour of my time, he was very cheerful to inform me that he could do nothing to help. We were stuck with the room, adding an hour and a half to our travel time. (We actually passed our intended destination and had to retrace our steps the next day.) Then we arrived at the hotel, and the real fun began. </p>
<p>I made a reservation in the Arbuckle Lodge in Gillette WY for one night via Hotels.com. The rate was very reasonable and the room was nice with bunk beds for my kids. The kids were very anxious to sleep in bunk beds! I prepaid for the room on a CC. Upon arrival I discovered that the hotel had cancelled my room and was now overbooked. The room with the bunk beds had been given away (I'm sure at a higher price). The manager's solution was to put us up in a cheaper room that did not have the bunk beds I had originally paid for. I was furious. My kids were heartbroken.</p>
<p>If I could I would give them NEGATIVE STARS. Consumer Beware! These people are dishonest! Just look at all the negative reviews left! All they care about is taking your money. No interest in helping. I will never use them ever again and I am warning everyone I know to watch out for their tactics. Hotel was willing to change the date of my reservation but I had to do it through hotel.com. They try to blame the hotel but it is Hotels.com who has the consumers' money and is unwilling to make the change without charging me more money. Of course if I change it to another date with a cheaper rate they refuse to refund my money.</p>
<p>BEWARE OF HOTELS.COM. They advertise the best rates, but they are NOT the best rates. I have always been quoted a better rate by calling the hotel front desk and getting a price quote directly from the hotel. Also, Hotels.com makes you pay 100% in full at time of booking, where the actual hotel only requires a small deposit and you pay the balance at check in. HOTELS.COM WILL RIP YOU OFF!</p>
<p>Hotels.com non-refundable room price $93.50, taxes and fees $37.02... 37.02/93.50 = 39.6%!!! Hotel website non-refundable room price $93.50, taxes and fees $14.03... 14.03/93.50 = 15%!!! Fool me once, only once!!! Hotels.com are crooks! Spread the word!!! Don't let them continue to get away with this!</p>
<p>I booked through Hotels.com and stayed at a Days Inn near San Antonio Texas. I complained when I arrived about the cleanliness of the room, the carpet was shredded in one area of the room and the bathroom shower was absolutely disgusting. I was told that unfortunately they were sold out and couldn’t be moved to another room. I called Hotels.com when I returned home a few days later to advise them of my unsatisfactory stay. The young lady I spoke with was very short with her responses and then she put me on hold to contact the property. She came back to the phone and said that the hotel had no record of my numerous complaints to them. She then stated that she didn’t feel that I said anything to the front desk at the hotel.</p>
<p>Hotels.com will not give me an itemized account of what I'm paying for. I stayed at a Red Roof Inn. They said they are charging me for a safe... I told them before using the room I didn't want that. They said they are adding taxes to the room that are not on the bill. And for my ten day stay I left 2 days early and Red Roof Inn said I would get credit for that. But RRI couldn't give me a bill, they said Hotels.com would give me a bill. Now Hotels.com says they can't itemized the bill, I just need to look on credit card to see what it is. BS!!! I will never use Hotels.com again... Totally unprofessional.</p>
<p>I will NEVER use Hotels.com again. I was in the Portland OR area on a family vacation. After a long day, I booked a hotel on Hotels.com (Century Hotel) at 9:15 pm when I was down to 3% on my phone, I waited to make sure I got a confirmation number and email saying it was guaranteed, then didn't care if phone died. We finished up dinner and headed to the hotel which was 30 min away in the opposite direction we were heading the next day. Got to the hotel at 11:30 pm, and they told me, "Sorry you don't have a room anymore, your payment wouldn't go through. We tried to call you."</p>
<p>After making a reservation on the Hotels.com website, I found that I could not make a change on their website. So I contacted hotels.com customer service, and spent almost two hours on the phone with two separate supervisors before they finally contacted the hotel to supposedly make the change. I then received an email confirming the modified reservation. And yet when we arrived at the hotel, the front desk had no record of the fully pre-paid reservation. When I called hotels.com for the third time that day, (and by then I was pretty angry,) they told me they did not understand why I was upset. We waited 45 minutes in the lobby while they struggled to "resolve" the issue and ultimately booked our room directly with the hotel. I will NEVER book through the hotels.com website again.</p>
<p>We rented a room to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday and our upcoming wedding. We purchased tickets to a concert in Toronto that we were attending that night as well. We booked on DEC 3 2017 for July 11 2018 through the Hotels.com app. When we arrived we found out that the room was booked for Dec 3 2017 instead and we were a no show. Hotels.com would not refund us any $ and said it would be up to the Fairmont Royal York Hotel and so far we have not had any luck. :( So we are out the 208$ plus we had to pay for another room which cost us 390$!!! We have deleted Hotels.com app and will definitely be dealing directly with the hotel next time and it won't be the Royal York.</p>
<p>Made the mistake of giving Hotels.com all my business for two vacations last year. One to Europe for 3.5 weeks and one in the States for 10 days. I carefully booked every room through them. Went to book my vacation for this year, expecting to use the free rooms that I earned and boom, points expired a couple of days ago. Tried to reason with them and they flat out refused. Fortunately there are other services where I can book points for free rooms only they offer 24 months and have much better reviews. Take my advice and do not use Hotels.com. Wish I would have looked here first.</p>
<p>I recently booked a room through Hotels.com. The price of the room was listed as $149. When I put in my credit card information then I got the receipt and it came up as $252 a night. There was a cleaning fee included and taxes and fees. $103 dollars a night for TAXES and FEES! On top of everything else I could not cancel the room without having to pay the full amount. I will never book anything through hotels.com again. @hotels.com #hotels.com.</p>
<p>The names and people have not been changed to protect the innocent. This is my story. On June 09, 2018, I booked a room at Stay Alfred at the cost of 183.60$, via Hotels.com (headquartered in Texas, and owned by their parent company Expedia). I woke up this morning thinking I would get ready to check out my new location. However, the morning quickly became a nightmare, as the hotel gave me an email that I have been charged 308.00. Wondering what in the world is going on, I phone the hotel and talk to them about the 40% price increase. They inform me it is for a cleaning service fee. Thinking I can never justify paying 120$, just to stay in a place for a night and have them make the bed when I leave the next morning. </p>
<p>My wife and I recently booked a trip through this website for a trip to visit with her sister's family at a BMX race in Pennsylvania. We had booked with them in April for this trip (July 6-9) got a confirmation number and had our credit card charged. No worries, right? Wrong. We were actually at the event with our family, who traveled 13 hours to be there, in the same hotel as us. At the end of the day, since we were running late (like 7 pm) we decided to call to let them know we would be checking in a little later since we were going to all go to dinner after a great day of racing. That's when we found out that our room HAD BEEN CANCELLED! How can that be? We had a reservation AND we already paid for it? GREAT QUESTION! </p>
<p>I had a reservation through Hotels.com for seven nights at a hotel, which I went to cancel a day in advance. I found another place to stay that was free. The total amount of the stay was over $1,500. The hotel has a policy, which was (to be fair) stated in a couple lines in the rather complicated Hotels.com reservation system, that all reservations are paid in advance and absolutely non-refundable. I didn't have to check off an option that says "I understand that this is a completely non-refundable reservation." Considering that $1500 was completely non-refundable, this is obviously an important detail to confirm. Unfortunately, it was a $1500 mistake that I didn't notice these two lines.</p>
<p>Have been using Hotels.com for several months and have called multiple times because I am not getting credited for the nights I’ve booked. Customer service is the worst I’ve experienced - literally had people end chats or hang up on me mid-conversation. My credit card was charged but they claim there is no record of my bookings even with the confirmation number...please don’t be fooled by Hotels.com! Not worth the loss of money and time.</p>
<p>Hotels.com Itinerary: **. I made a reservation using Hotels.com for a Motel 6. When I showed up at the Motel 6 and gave them my ID, they said they had no record of the reservation. I showed them the email that Hotels.com sent me and they explained to me that hotels.com did not send them a copy of the reservation either via email or fax and that the email Hotels.com sent me only had a Hotels.com itinerary # and not a Motel 6 confirmation #. I called Hotels.com and was put in touch with their Filipino call center. The call center said they sent the email and fax to the Motel 6 but the Motel 6 did not reserve it. Moreover the Filipino call center could not provide a Motel 6 reservation number. After that the Motel 6 shift manager called Hotels.com and also had no success. I BEGGED for someone in America and was not connected to one. I ended up sitting in the Motel 6 lobby for 2 hours, making 5-6 calls to Hotels.com to keep begging them to help me. </p>
<p>We booked a night in a hotel in Germany with Hotels.com for a one night stopover. When we arrived at the hotel at 7 p.m., with two children, they did not have our booking and we were turned away, despite our having a printout and email from hotels.com confirming our booking for that night at the hotel, which was paid in full three months earlier. I tried to contact Hotels.com while talking to the hotel receptionist, but got no reply to phone or chat, although it is supposed to be a 24 hour service. We had to pay a much higher last minute rate for another hotel, and a taxi fare to transfer. Really appalled by this. After contacting Hotels.com they are refunding the original charge, but there will be no compensation for the additional fees incurred. It seems that this organization can't even carry out the basics of their business -- actually making the booking. Furious.</p>
<p>This also pertains to ref. number: **. Roughly 7 am, on June 28, 2018, I arrived at Motel 6 as they are the only motel I know of who allows a check in this early. In fact, it begins at 6. Upon check in, the front desk and manager were unable to find any trace of my reservation in their system. What followed was one of the worst days of my life, I experienced a level of incompetence I had never dreamed imaginable. For almost two hours I begged pleaded with reps whom barely spoke English, merely trying to help them understand the simple task at hand: notify the motel I did in fact have a reservation. </p>
<p>I paid in full and reserved a vacation home in Kissimmee, Fl (Aco Premium-6bd w/Pool, spa, game room (1522). I received my confirmation for a week stay which was done in April for a trip in June. On June 17th I received another email confirmation with a picture of the rental home, on the day of check-in I received an email for a total different property a 4 bedroom in Clermont, Fl. I was very confused and called Hotels.com, I was transferred around to at least 6 different csr reps which said because I checked 2 people they wouldn't accommodate my stay in the home I paid for. </p>
<p>Crown Plaza Tel Aviv clearly spells out their cancellation policy which was submitted a month prior to check in. The illustration of the property as well as assurance from the CSR of certain features was &amp; is inaccurate. The property website, at a later date, revealed that balcony doors would be shuttered till September. I just want them to credit my account &amp; save the bother of protesting the charge to Amex. Is it worth $253 to tarnish the reputation of a well known organization? Come on guys this not the way to conduct business.</p>
<p>They charged the credit card I used to reserve the hotel with and I got charged on the card I used when I got there. My mother had a stroke and I had to deal with quite a lot of money being taken that I couldn't afford, I had used my Paypal Business Credit Card to Pay for the Hotel (I was lucky enough that I've been with them long enough that after I asked for a chargeback that Paypal gave me a sort of 'credit' on the money that was taken by Hotels.com). I spoke with the Hotel - it wasn't them. I spoke with Hotels.com and they said I didn't give enough notice on my cancellation. I'm like, "I'm in the hotel!" Long story short they still charged me a "Cancellation fee". I didn't have time to mess with helping Paypal fight it as I was staying at the hospital with my mother, I was devastated and Hotels.com was ripping me off - Don't ever use this "company"!</p>
<p>We booked our hotel through Hotels.com for a weekend in PA for my uncle's 90th birthday. At check out I received a receipt from the hotel showing the charges were $117.95. Once I checked my account on Monday with my bank Hotels.com had charged me $138.75 when I called to inquire why and ask for the difference back I was told that they could assure me that they gave me the lowest price possible and that the hotel was wrong. They had charged me correctly and would not refund. I will NEVER use this site again and warn others to double check your accounts if you do. I believe they are charging additional fees that are not being disclosed. Very unhappy with their service and disappointed that there is no recourse.</p>
<p>I had to cancel a day before my scheduled stay, so I called both the hotel (Marriott of Princeton), as well as Hotels.com. I was assured by Marriott that I would not be charged, and received a cancellation notice from hotels.com. After checking my credit statement, I was still charged by hotels.com. The customer service rep (who barely spoke English) for hotels.com claimed that the charge was from the hotel, and could not be recouped. That was an outright lie, and I have yet to receive my refund from hotels.com.</p>
<p>I booked a room 6 hours from home for my children and I. I paid with my debit card 1 month prior to the stay. I was aware that the funds were non-refundable. I arrived at the hotel to find out that the pool was closed. I chose this hotel so my children could swim. While checking in and realizing the pool was closed, I explained I will not be accepting the room due to not receiving what I paid for. </p>
<p>I booked a room yesterday through Hotels.com. I've used them before with no problem. I found a really good deal online and attempted to book the reservation. There were problems with the website so I called. The deal I'd found was no longer available. I ended up reserving a room at Meridian Inn in OKC. I was told it was a star hotel. It anything but that. It was smelly, the chair had stains and the walls had something splattered on them. I complained and was moved to another room which was better, but there was no kitchenette, no toiletries except soap, the air conditioning didn't work and I saw a roach. I will never go to Meridian Inn again and I will never use Hotels.com again!!!</p>
<p>I called Hotels.com on June 7, 2018 to see if they would price match a hotel I found on Booking.com for $66 cheaper/night. After being on the phone for 30 minutes, a representative was finally able to confirm that, although he couldn't book the hotel at Booking.com cost, he would credit me the $66 difference on my Hotels.com account. 10 days later, when I still couldn't see the credit on my account, I contacted Hotels.com customer service and they said they had no record of my conversation and there was nothing they could do. I provided a screenshot of my phone call information as well as my confirmation number: **. I obviously would have booked on Booking.com if I wasn't promised a reimbursement! Be warned that Hotels.com does not look out for their customers.</p>
<p>I booked a room several months in advance for a big trip I plan to take in summer and then I found the room on booking.com for half the price. I then called customer service and after about an hour was told it will take a few weeks to show up on my credit card. Great. Done. Not too bad I thought. I then received an email from the hotel telling me they no longer offer the room time I booked through hotels.com and they have put me into another not so good (in my opinion room type).</p>
<p>Since when does Hotels.com offer condos? If it's Hotels.com you'd think it's specifically for HOTELS. Might as well go to Airbnb if I wanted a condo. On top of that how can a cancellation policy be in May when we're in June? Shouldn't they at least give 24 hrs or at the very least an hour to cancel a reservation? I'm at wits end that the "hotel" I reserved doesn't even answer their phone yet can accept my money without even to have to speak to me. Hotels.com called the merchant themselves and they didn't answer them either. I think if they're offering these "condos/rooms" they should be able to communicate with that merchant themselves! Ridiculous. No refund, no answer, no cancellation. What should I be expecting when I show up to this "condo"?</p>
<p>Worst customer service experience ever. Was provided with wrong information by 6 people in a row. Ever since I made a booking with them, I’ve been spending my days arguing with them on the phone. They don’t know what they are talking about. Staffs including supervisors are poorly trained. Please avoid Hotels.com at all cost. They are nothing but nightmare. I was provided 6 credits/coupons due to price match. Each rep confirmed that all my coupons are valid and will be working for 12 months. It’s not even a month, they cancelled 4 out of the 6 credits without informing me. What a scam.</p>
<p>A hotel in Rome was booked on Hotels.com on March 1, 2018 at Boutique Home Roma for 9 people, one of which is 81 years old. This was a 4 bedroom apartment in the center of Rome. The reservation was confirmed and prepayment was made on a credit card. On June 16, an attempt was made to contact the hotel to confirm the reservation. The contact information was not provided on the reservation. Multiple calls were made to Hotels.com to obtain the information. On June 17, a call was made to the Rome hotel that stated that they do not book through hotels.com. Hotels.com did not address accepting the reservation without authority despite hours on the phones and conversations with three supervisors.</p>
<p>I was traveling on government orders to conduct military funeral honors, we were notified two days prior to the service. I have to use a government credit card for all of my travel expenses. The rules for using the card is that it has to be under the limit that they give us and we cannot pay taxes. Whenever I booked the hotel it didn't say that I was going to be charged then, I thought that they just needed something on file, with the taxes I was over my authorized limit. I arrive at the hotel and give them my tax exempt form and they tell me that the hotel was already paid for by the website and that they have nothing to do with it and that I need to contact the website. I call the customer support and explain my situation. They say that they cannot help me so I talk to the manager and she says the same thing. So I ask her if I can get just $11 refunded so that I can at least be under my limit and she says no as well. I will never use this website again.</p>
<p>I booked through them on a few occasions with no problem. I was going to an event in Asbury Park NJ so I booked through them. Well a hotel that I didn't book with charged my card and neither the hotel or hotels.com will refund the money. I now have to get the bank to help me dispute the charges. POOR PRACTICES, LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY.</p>
<p>We booked an apartment for a couple of nights in Brighton, UK. Apparently we were to call a number 24 hours ahead to find out how to get the key. This information only appeared in the Hotels.com app and not on the confirmation email. Without the app, we did not know to do this. We arrived at the apartment block early, in the hope of leaving our baggage. We found that the apartments were privately owned with no reception or any way of talking with someone who could help. We called the number on our confirmation but there was no response. Worried about the lack of response we went for lunch and called Hotels.com to see if they knew what we should do about getting the key. They tried calling the owner and also got no response.</p>
<p>Stayed in Capitol BNB, great place. Tried to call owner to get parking advice for downtown DC, the number that Hotels.com provided was not a working number. Turns out the owner has been asking them to change it for months now. I recommend not trusting Hotels.com, the hotels they set you up with are great, but Hotels.com as a web service are just horrid to work with.</p>
<p>I lost $160 for a night in a hotel that I did not use because of them. They charged my CC even though I canceled the reservation within 24 hrs and the hotel did not issue a refund. MY CC company could not dispute this charge because it happened to be nonrefundable which hotels.com did not tell about. Lost a ** $160 because of these ** Indians. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!</p>
<p>Twice Priceline.com has beaten Hotels.com for me. The agents on the phone with hotels all saw the better deal and I sent repeated screenshots and still the company refused to price match. Don't use them False Advertising and promises. Agents lie to get you to book through them, and don't put the notations they say they are so when you call back to confirm if there is a problem you're screwed. Then they say they will give you compensation for not adhering to their promise but then don't do what they promised.</p>
<p>Had to go to a conference. Decided to use Hotel.com. The hotel I chose was nothing like on the website, I am disabled and that they told me that they would put this in my reservation. When I got there they did not honor this nor did they not to see my actually handicap sticker. Put me on the second floor, the hotel was not clean and service was awful. Hotels.com was not accommodating when I explained this to them, and when I explained this to a manager, he seem very unconcerned about my conditioned.</p>
<p>I booked a hotel for a recent stay. I could not get the online coupon code to work so I called the booking website and was guaranteed by the booking agent that I would be reimbursed within a week for the difference. I agreed to this, then after a week passed and I was not contacted, I contacted the company and was informed that because there was some fine print excluding the hotel I happened to book from the promotion they would not do what they promised and reimburse me for the difference. I would not have booked this hotel and would have used another coupon if I was told this at the time of booking. Very unethical company.</p>
<p>We booked air and hotel package November 2017 for $1,806.00, charged for a portion of the trip at that time, not uncommon per prior experience, Visa credit card provided. Attempt to check in on 5/18/18 with Wow Airlines (partnered with Hotels.com for flight portion of trip) and we're told that the “flights were cancelled due to non payment.” Never received notification of this cancellation, no email, no phone call, Visa/Capitol One never notified me that they declined payment AND they always do this! We had also purchased trip protection from Hotels.com and received nothing in return. We booked round trip air the morning of our original flights 5/19/18 for $4,899.00.</p>
<p>I booked a hotel. It says the price per night was $138.00. I booked because it was a good price. I entered my credit card information and the price per night is still $138. I booked for 2 nights. It specifically says the currency which is CAD currency. When I received a confirmation, the amount confirmed was $436.32 CAD. So I called to ask why. They said that the displayed price was average price. They are fooling people. If the displayed price is $138.00 and I booked for 2 nights then it should only be twice the amount.</p>
<p>I booked this B&amp;B Room 110 in Bari Italy through Hotels.com. When I arrived they moved me to another property which was not theirs but an apartment. When I went out for breakfast, I returned to find all my belongings stolen. I was left with what I was wearing. The B&amp;B and owner of the apartment took no responsibility. I lost $3,000 in clothes, electronics, and medications. A dream of traveling for 6 months in the EU was shattered. Avoid this man and his properties. I notified Hotels.com. They offered no support in helping me recover my losses and assumed no responsibility for posting a despicable property owner. They continue to allow this person to use their reservation site. I think some sanctions were the minimum they could provide. Solution: use the site to find a property and book directly on the actual hotel's web page.</p>
<p>Logged in to Hotels.com to book a room for a return trip from Ohio to Texas. Entered "Benton, AR" and hit return. It brought up hotels in Bentonville. I did not notice this and reserved a room in what I thought was Benton. Tried to find a confirmation email and could find none on my phone, my wife's phone nor our laptop. Thinking we did not have a reservation I went back to Hotels.com and this time noticed that when I put in Benton, the first selection on a long list of selections was Bentonville. I tried to explain to Hotels.com that made no sense since I correctly entered Benton, AR. </p>
<p>Made a booking for couple of rooms for colleagues at work. Mistakenly entered wrong number of people. Cancelled and re-booked. Cancelled reservation cost me 50% as penalty. Called customer service (somewhere out of United States), went thru different managers and NICA, the manager, finally was able to refund 100%. I am a happy camper and would use them again for my business and pleasure trips.</p>
<p>Urgent RESOLUTION required. I am reaching out to you as a point of escalation post waiting for resolution. This is with booking reference no. **. Summary: at 9pm last evening I was attempting to book 2 rooms at Novotel Suites Wien for 4 nights starting 26th May till 30th May on Hotels.com. It kept indicating that my cvv needs to be re-entered. This attempt was made thrice. I called the helpline immediately. Spoke to Jyotika the supervisor for 45 mins. To my horrific shock it shows dates at 26th June to 30th June. It seems to be a major error on your site. </p>
<p>We made a reservation at Hotels.com and when we got to the hotel we had to call a phone number to check in. A man came out slurring his words and was filthy. He showed us the room. It had a musky, mildew smell. The metal on the beds had rust. We refused the room and he became angry. He told us to go ** ourselves and we would not get a refund. The entire amount for the room was take from our account before we even got there. Hotels.com told us that they could do nothing. We had to go through the hotel. We lost $445. We are disputing the charge but that takes time and a lot of trouble. Look out.</p>
<p>I traveled from Singapore to Suzhou and had a booking at Riverside Hotel by Hotels.com. The hotel was in the outskirt and not easily accessible by car. The taxi dropped me a distant away and I had to tugged my luggage and walked about 600m under the hot sun. When I reached the hotel I was told Hotels.com did not send my booking and despite showing my booking confirmation letter and reference number I was not allowed to use the booking rate. I had no choice but to book into another hotel. When I came back to Singapore I called Hotels.com to lodge a complaint. I had to wait a very long time to get someone to answer my call and when the person who answered knew the nature of my call I was put on hold for a long time again and eventually the line was cut off. This happened to all my 3 calls.</p>
<p>I made a reservation on 1/4 for 2 rooms (me, wife, two kids). On May 5th, that is, a full FIVE MONTHS after the reservation was fully paid, confirmed and "guaranteed" by Hotels.com, I received a message from the hotel saying they would cancel it due to 'pricing issues' and that I would have to call Hotels.com. I did, 3 times, one via chat with full written records. In each, being assured it was just a temporary technical glitch. On 5/14, Hotels.com contacted me via email to say that the reservation was in fact "not honored" by the hotel. It's now less than a month to the day of travel. </p>
<p>I had never used Hotels.com until recently. I had to attend a family function in St Petersburg, Florida. Not knowing the area I thought going through a place like Hotels.com would be a plus &amp; take all the guesswork out of it. Wrong. The accommodations were totally misrepresented. What I was promised and what I ended up with were entirely different. What I thought I was getting was an upscale resort on the ocean. What I ended up with was a run down Mom &amp; Pop dive. I didn't stay. I tried contacting the management of the hotel with no luck - because no one was ever around or answered the phone. Hotels.com tried passing the buck and jerked me around from one representative to another. Finally I got the Credit Card company in the act. I learned my lesson. </p>
<p>I canceled a hotel stay. The amount was over $500 and was charged regardless. They have all kinds of reasons why I can’t get my money. I went through PayPal. On April 6 they gave a partial payment 176.00 and when I called to find out when I would receive the rest. They tell me they don’t owe me anything. I am out $347.00. Please help.</p>
<p>Hotels.com gives wrong information about the quality of the hotels on their website, do not listen or follow the customer concerns and they do not care as long as they get your money. Their customer service is incompetent. I had a very unhappy experience with them, they destroyed my vacation with their lousy service.</p>
<p>I have been a customer of Hotels.com for over 10 years. I have repeatedly referred them to many other people because they really took care of me. Anytime I had the slightest problem with a hotel, I called them and they corrected it or found a way to make up for it. When a solution could not be found, many times they would comp me another night, to make up for my disastrous experience. </p>
<p>AVOID Hotels.com at all costs as it will cost you and you won't get your money back. I booked two rooms with Hotels.com. My trip was cancelled so I went online to cancel the bookings. My credit card was already charged. So the free cancellation is not free. I tried cancelling it online and it said there was an error. So I called Hotels.com to cancel. They said I missed the cancellation period by 2 hours. What? It was 3 days before my trip. Reputable hotels ask for a 24 hour notice. This was a 72 hour notice. I couldn't get my money back so I asked to change the reservation dates to the following week. No... they would not let me change the dates even though they had availability. Basically they kept my money and told me... "You figure it out." Since they wouldn't refund my money but, they would rent the rooms to someone else... I didn't cancel the reservation. If I couldn't use it then they can't re rent either.</p>
<p>I received a gift card as a holiday gift and finally decided to use it. I spent two hours plus trying to book online and when that kept not working I called and talked to about six people who all barely spoke English who repeatedly sent me to other departments to only be told, "You can only book gift cards online." Why? Because they already have your money and only want new cash coming in. So I gave up and tried again today and of course the room I wanted was no longer available. Beautiful business model. Recapping: gift cards used online only at a few selected properties and when the site does not work for a whole day you are out of luck. I even had the foreigners on the phone admitting how bad they were. If I ever get to use the gift card will never do business with them again. Horrible from start to... well, not finish.</p>
<p>I recently made a last minute/day of booking through Hotels.com online. The hotel was displayed as available on the site. I booked the hotel room at 20:16, promptly following my booking my credit card was charged for the room and I received a message that check in time ended at 20:00. Essentially they had a room listed as available for that night after check in times had exceeded and charged me for it. I was unable to check in and had to scramble to make other arrangements. I’ve gone back and forth through email and by phone to reach no resolution.</p>
<p>I booked a hotel in Alexandria, Virginia, through Hotels.com in March 2018, for a long weekend. It was only about two weeks out from the reservation date, so rates should have been relatively stable. My credit card was charged the amount on the original confirmation, but when we checked out of the hotel after our stay, the amount billed was LESS THAN what we had been charged by Hotels.com. After noticing the difference of around $85, I contacted the hotel and was informed that I should receive a refund from Hotels.com for the difference. </p>
<p>I used Hotels.com to book 1 night. Feb 4 2018 I stayed at the Travelodge in Airport Blvd San Francisco, CA, I did get a email confirming it. They also booked me at the Days Inn which I was not aware. After getting home and checking my credit card that is when I seen the charges. Hotels.com admits they did not send me a confirmation on the Days Inn. Had the wrong email. Their mistake but will not credit my credit card, they dropped the ball and I have to pay for it??? Just heads up.</p>
<p>I could not hold meetings in that room, as it was close to the alley.</p>
<p>My experience with Hotel.com was extremely unpleasant. They made it very hard for us to get back the refund the manager at the hotel had promised us. I had to take off the day and travel to the hotel and call Hotel.com from there so that the manager could talk to a representative from Hotel.com - I will advise everyone not to book with Hotel.com.???</p>
<p>About a month or so ago I reserved a hotel in Avalon, CA on the Hotels.com application for a significant anniversary. We spent our wedding weekend there and have not been back since. I reserved 2 nights at the Secret Price which was 50% off, which was about $400 including taxes and fees for BOTH nights. It’s Monday. We are leaving Friday through Sunday. I just received an email telling me the price we will be charged is $797.00, but my Hotels.com App Account Manager says my total cost for two nights is $390.60. I’ve used this app for years and it always tells me what my total cost is going to be. So I called Customer Service — which is somewhere in India. They insisted that the app was wrong and I will be charged the almost $800. They would do NOTHING to stand by their own app’s quote! Thank you for ruining our special anniversary. Bless your soulless hearts! I will never use this app again!</p>
<p>I booked a hotel through Hotels.com. What I didn't realize is there were two numbers listed on their website. I thought I was calling the reservation line for the hotel company. I only found out after the fact and ended up paying way more than if I'd simply called the hotel directly. Don't trust these third parties, they overprice hotels and make you think they're "going fast".</p>
<p>On 4-20-18, I booked a room at the Greenville Inn &amp; Suites for that evening. This booking was made through Hotels.com. Hotels.com charged my credit card, and sent me an email stating "Your booking is guaranteed and all paid for." Reservation confirmation number was **. When I tried to check in at the hotel front desk, I was told there were no reservations and they were totally booked. The person I spoke to at the front desk stated that this occurs often as Hotels.com does not verify room availability.</p>
<p>I booked the suit in Calgary for one my co-worker by phone with Hotels.com. I got a confirmation about my reservation but there were some discrepancies. It was 2 addresses in my confirmation email. I called back to Hotels.com. They couldn't figure out too what address I booked. I spent about 3 hours at this day with this reservation. Also, in my email it says there is no reception desk. So I asked how I can get in. Agent told me to call the number for Newtel Suites that was in my confirmation but the number didn't work. I called back to hotel, they provided me with another that didn't work either. They tried call them too but no luck. I asked to cancel it but they told me it's not refundable. </p>
<p>I booked a room with Hotels.com for 4-16-18. I had wanted to stop and stay in Buffalo, WY. The Hotels.com website had a hotel by the name of the Buffalo Inn pop up with a “Great Rate” of $60 and a rating of “fabulous” but it was advertised as being 37 miles further away in Sheridan, WY. Please see the screenshot photo attached below for verification of the advertised location. I decided to drive a little further so that I could stay in this nice hotel and I booked the room. When I got to Sheridan, WY I pulled over to bring up the Buffalo Inn on my phone only to find out that the hotel was actually in back Buffalo, WY where I had wanted to stay.</p>
<p>I booked a hotel through Hotels.com. I do NOT recall seeing that there was no refund if I cancel, they must be very sneaky in putting that there when you book, or I never would have booked it. I then read the reviews on the hotel, which had pictures of filth, and said the hotel had ants and cockroaches. Obviously not staying there, so I called Hotels.com to cancel the reservation, two weeks before the stay. The man I spoke with called the owner of the hotel, who said no, he would not cancel, nor give a refund, even though it was two weeks away. I disputed the charge. Hotels.com said there is no evidence I attempted to cancel, and they said I was notified there was no refund when I booked. </p>
<p>Made a reservation that had a free cancellation policy. When I tried to cancel, it said it had to be canceled by a backdated day from the time I made the reservation. I called 5 times to explain the situation. They kept on saying they could not refund me because of the hotel policy. I contacted the hotel directly via email, they respond that they did not have the cancellation policy Hotels.com is claiming they have. I let Hotels.com know and they are still refusing to refund my $. I had to open a claim with my credit card.</p>
<p>I tried to make a reservation with Marriott.com. I am a Silver Elite Rewards member. My friends and I are going to New York. I was researching hotel rates for September 28-30, 2018 for Manhattan, NY. I was comparing the price on the Marriott.com website and the Hotels.com website. Marriott.com showed –a lower price than Hotels.com. I looked for the phone number to call that Marriott because I wanted to confirm I could get the late check-out.</p>
<p>I booked a stay in Orlando during spring break nearly two months before the trip. With less than a week until the arrival date I received an email saying the property I booked was overbooked and could not accommodate me. They asked me to call. I called and spent over an hour on hold while the agent who barely spoke English found me something similar. Then, as I was driving to Orlando, at 11:30 pm the day before my scheduled arrival, Hotels.com called me and said my reservation could not be honored by the second property. I stayed on the phone until 1 am with them as they tried to find something for our family of five. </p>
<p>I should have read reviews on Hotels.com before I used them. They have rooms that are misrepresented on their site. I booked a room that was CLEARLY labeled BEACH VIEW on their site. When I got to thinking about the reservation a month later, I became a little worried since I had never used the site before and called the hotel directly to check on my reservation. It turns out that the suite I booked does not even come in a beach view! The hotel will not upgrade the reservation and they tell me I have to call Hotels.com. </p>
<p>As a courier service, we occasionally book rooms for our drivers when they have a delivery out of town. Made and paid for a reservation for our driver at Days Inn. Days Inn had no record of the reservation when the driver arrived, and said I, as the credit card holder, had to contact Hotels.com. The Hotels.com representative could not understand that I, as the owner of the courier service was their customer, not the hotel guest. He said that the guest needed to call. I said I would conference the guest into our call, and quickly did in less than 10 seconds.</p>
<p>I booked a hotel for a week and paid using PayPal. Unfortunately the hotel booked was dirty and full of cockroaches and mosquitos - even a room change didn't help so after 4 nights I changed the hotel completely. When I came back home I send an email to customer service - I had pictures and evidence - but hotels.com not even answered my emails - I tried different emails but nothing. So I asked PayPal buyer's protection for help - but they didn't help either. So my money is lost. I can only warn you to book with hotels.com - in case you have a problem they won't help you at all!</p>
<p>I used Hotels.com in the past for corporate use and the experience was stellar, they went above and beyond for us and made sure everything always went seamlessly. When situations out of our control would force us to cancel a reservation, they would refund us. No problem. Now, a year later, their motto has changed completely. Instead of customer first it's "I talked to the hotel and they said you can reschedule if you want, but no we won't refund you even though there's a strike at the airport and no one can fly into our country". Um, hello! This is like saying, "Hey, there's an earthquake in the area but too bad, you have to pay". Thanks for doing nothing, Hotels.com. You've lost a customer of MANY years.</p>
<p>Made a booking via hotels.com. Received email that hotel was fully booked. That's fine. Both hotel and hotels.com told me I should cancel through the other party. Then full cost was taken from my account! Unbelievable! Hotels.com customer service extremely unhelpful. Still trying to get the money from the hotel!!</p>
<p>At first, I was satisfied with this website. It was the first time I ever used a site like this. When I checked in at the Ramada in Hilton Head, everything went smoothly. Prior to making that reservation, I had made a reservation at Red Roof Inn located in Beaufort. Once I compared the two hotels I liked, I canceled the one at Red Roof Inn. It was two rooms under one reservation and all they canceled was the one room. So, a couple days into my trip, I get charged almost $75 for a room I didn't keep the reservation on.</p>
<p>I have been fighting with this company for 1 1/2 hours to get them to do a price match on a overpriced reservation for Radisson Decapolis Hotel Panama City. I took them to TripAdvisor and showed them the same reservation for $82 and they said... "I don’t see it" even though it’s in plain sight. Then they sent me an email (which I never received) so I could send them the link for the savings... 2 time. BY THE WAY THEY KEEP SENDING ME SURVEYS. Why do the WORST COMPANIES ALWAYS want a survey. THEY KNOW THEY ARE BAD. They then finally said to copy the link and send it to their billing dept and they would give me my credit. YEAH... RIGHT and the checks in the mail... And I won't say the other one.</p>
<p>We booked at the new JW Marriot, after booking our room here with HOTELS.COM we're charged in US funds even though our booking was set in Canadian funds. They refuse to fix the difference. I highly recommend you make some effort to either warn your customers of this scam or to stop allowing hotels.com book rooms in your hotel. This is unacceptable service, as I am sure you would agree. The hotel is in Canada, the room was booked in Canadian funds and I was charged USD on my Canadian Credit card for the room. So disappointing to have paid an additional 30% on this room unnecessarily.</p>
<p>This company, which stated that I could cancel a reservation with my confirmation did not do so when requested. When I arrived at the hotel, I found it to really slimy place and then they wanted to charge me a deposit for the room. In all the years and hundreds of rooms I have rented, this was unprecedented. I asked to cancel, but I found out that Hotels.com would not honor my cancellation and they went ahead and charged me.</p>
<p>0 stars if I could! Will be my first and last time using them. I booked 11 days at a hotel for a family member who missed his flight. I called the morning after booking online and was told that they could not communicate with the front desk because they didn't speak Spanish then asked me if I spoke Spanish. They then put me on hold then proceeded to tell me that to make a change to the reservation for the first 2 days, they would have to cancel it, charge me the full amount of almost $700 dollars, then rebook it for the amount of the 8 days. In what universe?!!! What sense does that make?</p>
<p>On March 6, 2018 I made a reservation in hotels.com website for Sept 22-25 2018 Marriott Hotel in Munich and as always I double check cancellation policy. I always check pay at the hotel. The website stated that nothing will be charged on my credit card, however when I received a confirmation of the booking it stated that I will be charged 90% cancellation fee. Within 20 minutes I cancelled it and they charged me $1197 on my card. I called them and they said it is not refundable. I am disputing the charge with the credit card company I used. This HOTELS.COM is a scam. DO NOT TRUST THEM.</p>
<p>I showed up to my hotel after booking on Hotels.com and they told me that my room was not held. Went back and forth with the lady and gave her my confirmation number and they told me it was canceled by hotels.com. The hotel wanted to charge me $50 more than I originally booked for. Left and went to another hotel. Called hotels.com when I got to the new hotel to explain the situation and they told me they would process a refund because they were "sorry." They are exactly that, SORRY, as a company. Calling now on 5 days later (because I haven't seen a refund) and they tell me they have nothing in their notes about me calling and getting a refund. What kind of trash company/service is this? STAY AWAY and do yourself a favor.</p>
<p>This is the worst booking agency for Hotels. They have a no refund policy that only becomes apparent after you hit the buy button. I made a reservation by mistake and tried to cancel it immediately. The only option was to forfeit all my money. No refund.</p>
<p>When making this reservation I specifically asked (as I ALWAYS do!) what the cancellation policy was. I was told by my booking rep that there was no penalty up to 2/28, which gave us more than a week to decide if this was where we would indeed be staying. I found a better deal but when I called to cancel at The Reef at Seahaven Beach Resorts, I was told there WAS/IS a penalty, and a very hefty one!!! I was furious and Hotels.com kept going back to try to get the resort to wave that penalty (that Hotels.com had lied to me about). The resort would not budge! I feel Hotels.com should pay me this money that they caused me to lose - $254.08!! I have put a stop payment on my American Express card as they investigate this, but this is of little consequence as I will NEVER trust Hotels.com information again! I'll be using Trivago from here on out.</p>
<p>I paid 65 dollars for a room at the flushing YMCA yesterday. Couldn't get to NYC because all buses shut down until Fri, tried to get a refund to book another room they will not refund me even with the storm. Book AT YOUR OWN RISK or else YOU will lose money if you can't make your reservation!!</p>
<p>Warning!! Do not book with hotels.com. My husband and I decided we would start our vacation one night early in Orlando. I was on hotels.com site and booked a room. We paid for the room and got a reservation. We had a reservation number. Problem... The page never refreshed... Odd. We showed up to the hotel they were completely booked! We used our American Express. Surely we could cancel this charge. American Express told us we would not get out of the charge. Even though we called from the hotel that was overbooked and they saw a second charge 30 minutes later, for another hotel!! </p>
<p>Hotels.com charged me more than the cost of the hotel would have charged. $102 over the hotel rate $79. Couldn’t cancel Hotel.com reservations because they would have charged me a no show fee equal to one night's stay.</p>
<p>Used hotels.com to book what was described as a bed &amp; breakfast in Santiago, Chile for a 6-day stay. When I arrived I was told my confirmed reservation was gone. I was offered a room only, sharing the bathroom/ toilet with essentially everyone staying there although I had booked a room w/ private bathroom. The breakfast was eggs, coffee &amp; white bread cooked by ourselves each day, after which we cleaned up using only cold water to wash dishes. So NOT a B&amp;B - a hostel. I was given a slightly reduced room rate that did not make up for the deception. I will never again book with Hotels.com.</p>
<p>The site is user friendly and performed as expected. I was able to book the hotel I wanted without any problems. I would definitely use the site again and recommend it to others.</p>
<p>I used the Hotels.com app to book a stay. However, there were two hotels of the same hotel chain with the same name, and unfortunately I booked the one that I did not intend to. The charge was also nonrefundable. I called Hotels.com to help resolve the issue. Hotels.com said that they called the hotel and they could not help. Initially Hotels.com customer service indicated that I could just pay the difference for the new hotel, but then within a minute, that option was gone and I have to pay the full price for both hotel reservations. I told them that is not a great solution.</p>
<p>I had used hotels.com to book a two night hotel stay. Their email to me confirming the reservation clearly stated that should I cancel within 7 days of my arrival date that I would only be charged for one night. When I canceled within two days of my arrival time, hotels.com gave me the major runaround. They told me to deal with the hotel, although I never booked with the hotel! They then told me I was a no-show, so they could not refund anything, etc etc. After spending hours on the phone with hotels.com, forwarding back to them the email before my booking confirming my cancellation of the with hotels.com (two days before my arrival) they simply told me to deal with the hotel once again!</p>
<p>When my wife booked a room online she was given a total. When she clicked "Book" the total changed considerably. She called Hotels.com immediately to get this straighten out and was told that there were additional Resort Fees, Room Fees, some other Fees the rep struggled to explain, and Taxes added to the Total. I can understand Taxes but after adding the other Fees we ended up paying more for the Room than the highest price we found on other sites that included additional Fees and Taxes. I went back to the Hotels.com site and searched closely for anything on any of the pages that showed the added Fees, I couldn't find it. She tried to cancel the reservation but was told that it was nonrefundable.</p>
<p>Both times I booked through Hotels.com, they did not transfer my reservation to the hotels. Both hotels told me they do not participate with them. As a result, I had to pay double, once to Hotels.com and again to the actual hotel upon arrival to be able to stay there. The follow up is even worse, is they consumed so much of my time to try to get the money back. The first time after much aggravation, numerous emails and phonetical, my money was returned. The second time, it was not. Even their supervisors are speaking to you from a foreign country and from a script, not able to really accomplish anything.</p>
<p>I booked thru 1-800-CA-Hotel, I was given wrong info after I used my credit card. They admitted that they made a mistake of the amount of the currency they charged me but I have to write them (Help E-mail line) to ask for the difference. They could not cancel it because it's non-refundable and the hotel charge directly to my credit card on top of that the conversion of currency might change. It's been 2 months still waiting that the Hotels.com will reply. Their price match guarantee has a fine print that if you booked non-refundable, you cannot get the difference of the price match till you done staying at the hotel and the Hotels.com will only give a voucher to use it for the future and it has one year expiration plus some restriction may apply meaning some hotel might not honor the voucher.</p>
<p>I booked through their app, and when I tried to complete my reservation, the app shows a message saying no longer available. So I move on to another app for available hotels. After couple days, when I open the app, it says the reservation is completed and charged me $300. This is a super rip off... A system problem and wanted customers to pay for it. What an untrusted company.</p>
<p>This website has got to be the biggest joke. I've yet to get an answer from any kind of a manager GM coordinator or anything of that nature. As a hotelier I can't understand why you let your cheap ** guests have the same perks as the ones paying full price. Why should someone be able to PREPAY NO CANCEL if those rules don't even apply? They cancel at the very last second just like full paying customers. The only thing is they don't have the option to cancel but Hotels.com still lets them. Take the ** policy away. You don't even enforce and do business the RIGHT WAY!</p>
<p>I booked a hotel in Lima, Peru in Summer of 2017 on, or about Apr 2017. It was listed as very good. When I got there it was a Dump, infested with Bed Bugs in a Crime Ridden area, i.e. "shootings in the streets". I didn't stay there longer than 1 day and demanded my money back! Was told to contact the owner, owner told me to contact the Hotels.com!! Hotels.com never gave me my prepayment back. I lost $400.00!!! RIP OFF. Even my PNC Bank was given the runaround.</p>
<p>I've booked with Hotels.com over 20 times over the last year. I've had maybe 3-4 issues out of all those transactions. Every time I've called their customer support and I always get an answer no matter what time (yes even at 1AM) with a short hold time. Usually they resolve my issue easily but tonight they couldn't because the hotel I booked said that they could not honor my reservation because they close their books at 10pm and don't accept late check ins. Of course I was upset with the hotel and myself--not with Hotels.com. But Hotels.com took the hit, refunded me AND gave me a full credit towards a new hotel. </p>
<p>Trying to use a credit  of 63 US hotel.com issued me - Spoke with live agent for 1.5 hours trying to book hotel for night away using credit owed by them plus extra monies from us. Kept having problem applying credit, and every hotel would get booked or prices would go up during process. This happened for 3 hotels. All they could say was "I'm sorry". Our 4th choice of hotel was available, surprise my husband's credit card was declined and I was told he needed to go to his financial institute. So I gladly used mine, same thing. Something wrong with my card. I needed to go to my bank too. His is CIBC mine TD. </p>
<p>Easy check in, gave ref number and name, room was ready, didn't have to wait till 3 PM to get into the room, and very clean, sheets were clean and put on correctly, not wet nor any surprise clothing left behind and the pillows didn't have an odor. Price for the room was very reasonable, lower than 85.00.</p>
<p>Whenever I have an issue with them they tried to roundabout ways of not making me feel that they are righting a wrong. They also clean to price match and so far every time they haven't but when I'm in a hurry or when I need an overnight stay I can call and most of the time get a decent price.</p>
<p>I booked a hotel which seemed good and well rated. We checked in and went to bed. They had a stage in front our bedroom window playing loud music. My husband thought the music would stop at 10 pm. Well it was 1130pm and the sound was loud and was just impossible to fall asleep. We called the front desk and they said they couldn't do anything. We had to request a refund from Hotels.com since we booked with them. We decided to leave at midnight as we couldn't sleep with that noise anyway. I then called Hotels.com and at first they said I had to stay in the hotel to receive some compensation. I was outraged as I didn't think that made any sense.</p>
<p>We booked a room through Hotels.com for my birthday. When we got there the hotel room was already occupied. We called Hotels.com and advised we would find a different hotel on our own after being transferred and put on hold many times the hotel said the reservation was non refundable and charged us for a room that was already occupied!!! The hotel said that Hotels.com threatened to charge them a commission and relocation fee, which is why they charged us. Hotels.com told us when we called they canceled with the hotel, since there were already people in our room!</p>
<p>I made a reservation thru this site. I needed to change the dates. 7 days before my arrival. They lied saying they called the property and told me the hotel's policy was to charge me a night for the change. Oddly, when I was able to speak to the hotel they happily changed my date with no charge which IS their policy. Just now when I called back HOTEL.COM to address this I was hung up on!!! NEVER EVER USE THIS WEBSITE.</p>
<p>I booked a room online on 1/22/18 through Hotels.com; the date we were going to stay was 1/25/18. It was stated in the fine print that there was a cancellation policy; the policy stated that if the room was cancelled by 700PM CST on 1/24/18 a refund would be received. I cancelled at 630PM CST on 1/24/18; I received no email to confirm my cancellation. On 2/8/18, I still had not received a refund. I contacted the hotel directly and was told that the hotel has a no-refund policy. I then contacted Hotels.com who told me that their records indicate that I cancelled the reservation on 1/25/18 at 1250AM CST. But that they would contact the hotel directly to attempt to resolve the dispute. In short I was told by Hotels.com that they could not get my money refunded. I will NEVER used Hotels.com again and I will be giving the hotel my review here as well.</p>
<p>I booked a hotel through Hotels.com in Philadelphia for the night before the Eagles Super Bowl parade (2/7/2018). Because of the huge crowd expected, hotel rooms were very hard to find. I completed my booking and received a confirmation number via email indicating that all was well. About 7 hours later, I got another email telling me that my reservation had been cancelled "because of a problem with my credit card." Don't ask me how it takes 7 hours in this day and age to validate a credit card, since this is instantaneous on basically every website I ever order anything from. I also used the same card several more times during that 7 hour period with zero problems. </p>
<p>The website conveniently starts by showing prices in CAD and charges you in US. I don't know how this is legal. The resulting receipt is unit-less and they charge you in US. This happened to me twice. Also to get the reward program they make you enter your password again (assuming you are already logged in) at the top of the last page or else it doesn't count to your rewards. These people are a joke, don't use them. You'll spend more time on the phone than in the hotel.</p>
<p>Just don't use Hotels.com. It's as simple as that. When you have a problem with one of the hotels you book through them, their customer service reps are ignorant, and never resolve your issues. They don't back you up in any way, shape or form. Most of them can barely speak English, and they don't even listen to what you are telling them. They keep reading script after script, like a broken record. Stay away please.</p>
<p>Very deceptive pricing in order to avoid Price Guarantee refunds. Hotels.com total reservation amount excludes hotel service fees. Booking.com's total reservation amount INCLUDES hotel service fees. The Hotel.com Price Guarantee policy only goes by "Total Reservation Amount" so Hotel.com found a way to void the Price Guarantee by not charging the hotel service charge, your price appears less than Booking.com's Total price because they include the hotel service charge.</p>
<p>Multiple hotel bookings in India November 2017 - As part of a 3 week holiday in New Delhi, Jaipur, Agra and Kerala I booked hotels in each location through Hotels.com. On arrival in India I went to the first hotel and found that it was nothing like that promised in the website and it was impossible for me to stay there. I went online to book a different hotel through Hotels.com, when I went to that hotel I was told there was no room and despite the fact that Hotels.com had taken payment in full they would not help. I ended up walking the streets looking for a hotel to stay in after my 20 hour journey getting to India. </p>
<p>Hotels.com website does not allow for requesting specific floor needed such as ground which was required for transporting elderly relative who could not walk. Therefore resorted to calling number listed on website... 855 516-1093. For a higher nightly fee two adjacent rooms were supposedly reserved on ground floor. Upon arriving at Best Western Plus we were informed they had no ground floor rooms and we were booked on the 4th floor. Best Western blamed the situation on 3rd and thus nothing they could do! Beware...</p>
<p>I made a reservation for a "Room, 1 Double Bed with Sofa bed, Non Smoking (&amp; Sofa Bed)" the Hotel Holiday Inn SP, Liverpool England on 22nd May 2017 through hotels.com, to my amazement I was debited, which is not normal. I eventually canceled this reservation on July 3rd, 2017, and I received a mail saying a refund of the money debited will be made available in my account, I have lodged several complain from my bank branch in Zone 4, Abidjan, but all to no avail. I have contacted hotels.com for over 7 months now and yet the refund was not made. Hotels.com claims the debiting party (Holiday Inn SP, Liverpool England) is presently not in service. My bank also instructed I contact the send because no sign of incoming transaction at all. Can anyone advise what to do to have my money back. Total cost of reservation was £757(British Pounds Sterling).</p>
<p>Displaced traveler due to aircraft maintenance issues. Very tired and thought airline agent wanted us to make our own reservations. I tried to cancel within 10 minutes of making reservation, told too late no refunds available. The person I got on the phone blamed the hotel. I called hotel and they said it was the 3rd party that would not refund. Never again. I understand having policies in place but then there is taking advantage of people in a bad situation that they have no control over.</p>
<p>I made the reservation tonight 1/16/18 for a business trip. Both myself and boss looked over dates and location. Once we booked their Non-Refundable room it sent me a confirmation of 1/21 check in. I was This was Not the dates selected. I immediately called to ask what happened to my dates I booked with and why did it now say the 21st. He claimed a system glitch and verified with hotel that they had a room tonight. It was decided to be fixed at No extra cost or penalties. 2 hours later I called hotel to touch base since I was en route. NO reservation was ever submitted. I went online to type in the code they gave and it showed not only 1 room booked but I was charged with 2 rooms. I called Hotels.com to ask why and why my correct reservation was never sent over and was told their systems are down and call back in 2 hours???</p>
<p>After being a loyal customer, Hotels.com deactivated and expired my earned 3 nights stay. There are periods of time in life when travel is not possible, and a notice to this effect should be reasonable to expect. Their prices are higher anyway, the hotel rooms you can book are at a minimum and low end, and it is not possible to use your points toward an equal amount on the cost of an upgrade. A total ripoff, and there is no reason to use this company.</p>
<p>Hotels.com linked 2 different e-mails into one account without notifying me. It does not even say on my account pages that the two e-mails were linked. As a result of this, only 1 e-mail for the WHOLE account can collect rewards. This was not made clear at any point in time as all of this was done without my consent or knowledge. I understand that sometimes mistakes like this can happen, and there are issues with the system that occasionally occur, so I called in and wrote in to see if I can have this situation rectified. The phone operator basically fed me lines straight from their protocol book and explained that although this was an issue with their system, she could not do anything to help me. I asked to speak to her supervisor to see if I would have any luck rectifying the situation, however, he was extremely rude and unhelpful.</p>
<p>I have booked a hotel reservation through Hotels.com, the check-in date will be some time in 6 six months later. I originally booked with refundable, but by mistake from my side, I changed the booking to be non refundable. But I did not know that, and I thought my booking was fully refundable. Then today I decide to cancel the booking since my travel plan has changed. However, I realized that the booking has been changed to be non-refundable after my cancelation. I called Hotels.com immediately to explain the mistake and ask for their help. The response I received was very unconcerned and it said to me nothing that they can do at this moment. I request them to revoke my cancel and I decide to stay at the hotel anyway. But hotels.com said that it is the booking hotel's policy and they cannot do that. I was been told that it was my fault to lose all my money for the reservation.</p>
<p>I booked through Hotels.com. It specifically stated that I could cancel up to the date before the trip/booking. When you click on the FREE CANCELLATION button it reiterates that you can cancel up to the date before the trip/booking-- no mention of a specific time. When you actually book the FREE CANCELLATION pops up again and then it changes to include a time. Who would think there would be several different policies! When you review their site- the policies should not contradict each other and they should be clearly defined-- not hidden behind a link. And then the links for the same words are different-- like they want you to click on the first and believe it is the same throughout. I called 10 minutes after their second link which said I needed to call by 4PM (I never saw the fine print/second link). Although very nice, they called the hotel and told me there was nothing they could do. Very deceptive!! I will never use them again.</p>
<p>They are one of the worse third party companies. They lie, including the supervisors and so called managers. I had an issue with a refund. They kept saying it's the hotel that was holding up the refund, the hotel advised me that it was Hotels.com. There was never any continuity with the same manager or supervisor so I would get a different story with each call. Complete nightmare!!!</p>
<p>They are full of it! I almost collected the required 10 nights to earn a free stay only to be told that my rewards account was NEVER created when I KNOW it was. My last booking told me that I had 2 more nights til my free stay. Now all of a sudden they said I've never created the rewards account! I am spool angry right now I can't think straight. The only reason for booking through them was to earn free nights. I could have just called the hotels directly and booked based off of price matching. They are wrong and I understand why they only get 1 star and bad reviews.</p>
<p>Our booking experience with hotels.com has been very challenging and unacceptable. An error was made during booking and reservations were made in the wrong city. It was my mistake, which I discovered within 15-20 minutes. I immediately called and attempted to cancel the reservation. After speaking with 5-6 customer representatives, one of which was the hotel, I am told no one is willing to cancel this reservation and refund the charge to my credit card as this was a non-refundable reservation. This is completely unacceptable. I would have made an immediate reservation in the correct city but clearly that would have been another risk that at this point is unacceptable based on their unwillingness to correct the first booking. It is my belief I have been scammed.</p>
<p>I have made a reservation at Tuscany Hotel by hotels.com. The booking details from the hotels.com shows that cost for the booking is $311,01 including resort fee. However, the Tuscany Hotel has charged me $329. It is fair to take more money than the cost.</p>
<p>I (in Canada) paid for a $100 Hotels.com gift card which was sent (by Hotels.com) to my son in Arizona (for Christmas 2016). He is unable to use it in the US "because it was purchased in Canada." He is unable to use it in Canada "because he would be booking from the US." In other words, my money has been stolen by Hotels.com selling me an unusable product. I was told that someone from Hotels.com would email or phone me but, of course, that has not happened and it is impossible to actually send them an email message about this issue. I want my money back so I can just give my son the $100.</p>
<p>My sister and I booked with Hotels.com for a night before a cruise. As the cab pulled up to the property, a lady came out and said they were closed! We were NOT notified! Very unexpected surprise! We ended up going to another hotel and had to spend double! They offered a refund, but we were out additional cab fees and spending double was not in the travel budget. I have had success with domestic locations, but will not book a international location again.</p>
<p>We are booking a service-apartment suites in Toronto and paid in full upfront. It stated in hotels.com description it was a 24-hour check-in and that's one of the reason we booked it because our flight arrived 7AM. Suddenly we receive an email from the apartment 3 days prior to our reservation that the suites only available 3PM and we reply saying Hotels.com wrote that it's a 24-hour check-in so we called Hotels.com "customer service". They said probably we ended up looking at a wrong website but we already took a screenshot (8:54 PM) of it before we made that call. </p>
<p>I booked a hotel room through Hotels.com in Green River Utah back in October 2017. The web price through them was $117.88. I called them and I was told that I could reserve it for that price, but I would be charged the full price of 147.88 to my card, and I would receive a $30.00 rebate within 3 business days. I paid the full amount and received a confirmation #. I stayed at the hotel, but I never received the rebate after calling to complain 3 times. It's been 2 months since I stayed there and they tell me there are no notes so they can't refund me. I could have called the hotel directly and got the room for $133.15.</p>
<p>I was told incorrect information from hotels.com rep (Benjamin &amp; Paul) about breakfast included in a hotel package. The hotel confirmed we were given incorrect info. Hotels.com supervisors (George &amp; Randy) promised a credit which was never given. We got the runaround and spent HOURS on the phone with supervisors and reps. Every time we called back they said they couldn't find our notes or recorded conversations. Hotels should beware that hotels.com gives customers incorrect information about their stay. DO NOT talk to these people from hotels.com. They will lie and say they will call you back and promise credits, but you will never receive anything.</p>
<p>Will never use this company again, customer service is horrible! This company is not for the customer! I will go direct to the hotel from now on! You wait to speak with someone for over 30mins, for them to get on the phone and get all your information, mind you they have my phone number at this point for them to then put you on hold and hang up on you and not call you back. So I go to call back (another long wait) for them to just argue with me and tell me that their system is down and to call back in two hours, ironically everyone I spoke with was named 'David' but for them to tell me they have never seen my reservation before or have spoken with me. Meanwhile, I have 'David' telling me their system is down and I have my husband on the other phone speaking with 'David' to tell him the system isn't down. This company seems very fishy to me!!! Horrible!!!</p>
<p>I booked a hotel room in Larnaca, Cyprus and the price listed on the website was 62 dollars (It is still listed in dollars). When I arrived, they asked me to pay 62 euros, with no currency exchange. I complained to Hotels.com that they should convert the rate into dollars so that I would know how much to pay when I am browsing, but they said I should have noticed a disclaimer as I was checking out that said I would be paying in local currency. That still didn't make it clear that I would not be getting a converted amount. 62 euros is more than 62 dollars. I went back and forth with customer service and they do not intend to change this so I do not intend to use their website anymore.</p>
<p>Three of us were using the site to find a hotel one of us had already traveled to. We found it and reviewed it; jumped to the website linked in the Hotels.com site and then used the back arrow to return to the Hotels.com site. Then we locked in the room at the hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were told it was actually made to a sister hotel 20-25 minutes away. We asked to have it switched. The hotel said they could easily do it, but Hotels.com disallowed the change. We ended up paying for two rooms and did not get the room we requested originally. We also had a better rate going directly to the hotel than what had been shown to us by Hotels.com, so never going to use them again.</p>
<p>I made a booking for a hotel in India through them. Due to some unforeseen reasons, I had to change my travel plans and I called to cancel my reservation and rebook the reservation. According to the agent, they wanted to charge me for one day of hotel charges (fair) and all 10 days of taxes accrued (Thieves). I told them that this was not fair and they informed me that the Hotel Diplomat was doing this in India. I called the hotel and found out that the entire amount had been refunded and that Hotels.com agents were lying to me all along. I launched a complaint into the Visa fraud department and am in the process of recouping all my funds from them. Do not book with them. You are better off paying a little bit more and going online with an honest company.</p>
<p>Reserved 3 nights, called to change to 2 nights. They said "no problem". Got billed twice for 3 nights and again for 2 nights (this was an upscale resort). Called Hotels.com and after an hour on the phone, I still had to pay $600 penalty. They NEVER told me about any penalties and I argued this point. Got nowhere. Finally they gave me a coupon for $250. Did not want coupon (to use with their website only). What a rip off... Will never use them again. They can take their coupon and put it in the appropriate place.</p>
<p>Booked a room for this weekend (11/18-11/19) at the Hilton Southlake Town Square and reservation was moved to the 12/08-12/09! Drove 6 hours and only after unloading the car, valet taking the car, and going to check-in I was notified that the date on the reservation was changed! Two kids, my wife and two dogs were stranded. No rooms available at this hotel or any others in a 20 mile radius of where we needed to be. We felt left in the cold (in a literal sense) and embarrassed!</p>
<p>I booked a hotel in China, Xi'an called "Sunshine Theme Apartment". The hotel accepted my offer and I had free change and refund policy. However, I later made changes to the booking and suddenly I couldn't cancel the hotel anymore even if I wanted to. I was still going to Xi'an however, so that didn't really bother me. The hotel I'm talking about is linked here: **. When I arrived after 1 AM, there was nobody at the hotel. A friendly man who helped me find the hotel in the first place tried calling them, but no avail. I thanked him and he left to continue his night. I decided to wait at the hotel until someone arrives. I waited for two hours on the ground resting my eyes, and then some customers of the hotel finally arrived. They helped me call the hotel again, and finally someone replied. They said that they don't accept foreign bookings, which is common in China, and that I should contact Hotels.com for refund.</p>
<p>I reserved a room for 3 nights in Detroit in early November for a conference back in October. I live east of Montreal and choose to drive there so it's about a 13 hour drive. 5 hours into the drive on what was going to be first night stay, I got an email saying my reservation was no longer available and to call the service line. This was around 3 pm in the afternoon so around check in time had I been in Detroit already. The lady said the hotel was not available anymore due to overbooking and they would put me in a different hotel and make up the difference in charges. I said ok and that because I was part of a conference, I needed to be in the area of the conference center and suggested a few places she could check, one of those being the Holiday Inn Express Downtown Detroit which was a listed overflow hotel for the conference.</p>
<p>While in the Philippines our honeymoon was extended one day in Manila. Instead of striking the 7, I struck the 8 for the date by mistake. Unwittingly I made an error in sending the booking request before rechecking the date. Immediately after sending the request, I noticed my mistake, but when I contacted the 800 number given in their website, I was put in some kind of automated loop that could not respond to my requests. Once I finally got a hold of a live person which took a lot of finesse Hotels.com refused to credit the mistake, and even lied about attempting to credit us by contacting the hotel. Months later after my bank ran an investigation Hotels.com refused to release our funds hiding behind a trumped policy. They flat out refused to give our money back for a simple mistake. This is nothing less than theft by deception and I would like the world to know the character of this operation.</p>
<p>I bought hotel voucher to Patong, Thailand to stay at the BYD Lofts Boutique Hotel for 5 nights. When I see the price for 2 adults (5 nights) it is Aud 2299 w/ breakfast. Since we are travelling with another 2 children, we put 2 adults and 2 children on our booking with the Hotels.com. Then the price becomes $2969 which very reasonable since we have 2 extra children in the room. Everyone will assume the difference in the price which is Aud 670 is to cover the 2 children. However, when I asked Hotels.com, they said I still have to pay extra bed and extra breakfast to the hotel at the hotel's charge. This is the first time I book through Hotels.com with the reference from my ANZ credit card. However I felt tricked and I could have booked under 2 adults and use the difference of $670 which I paid extra to Hotels.com, I can pay it directly to the hotel to cover the extra bed and breakfast for my kids.</p>
<p>I couldn't attend an event in Santa Barbara, Ca., so I canceled the room. I looked at my bank account and they had taken the full amount out. I called the hotel, and they said I had checked in, but that they also said that I had canceled. It was something "the system" did. I get tired of these incompetent people who can't tie their shoes without relying on "the system". I will be getting in touch with a class action attorney, and we will see how their "system" works then. This is a consumer ripoff, and needs to be stopped.</p>
<p>I booked a hotel on Hotels.com. I called the hotel to get directions after I had booked it on Hotels.com. The lady did not speak English and did not understand. I did not know how to get there and kept hanging up on me. I never stayed there and Hotels.com will not help me to get my money back. -0 rating and I would never recommend them to anyone. Customer service was rude and no help and just said they were not going to refund my money.</p>
<p>I booked a Marriott Hotel several months ago through Hotels.com and never received the email confirmation. I found my reservation and attempted to cancel; they claim it is non-refundable. I contact the hotel directly and they contradict what I was told. I call Hotel.com back and they keep telling me the hotel will not refund; they have not been paid yet according to Marriott. This crap has gone on for 4-days. Lesson learned, book direct and screw third party websites.</p>
<p>I was booking a room at Mission Point Resort at Mackinac Island, MI through Hotels.com for a special weekend at the end of October. I called Mission Point for information and they couldn't find my reservation! They said I had to call Hotels.com to find out what up. I called Hotels.com and got the typical awkwardly friendly broken-English call center they said my reservation was for September - and the dates don't even match the dates I reserved IN October! However, my checking account was debited of the full amount IMMEDIATELY! She put me on hold and said she was calling Mission Point.</p>
<p>Had to cancel my room. After speaking with two reps explained I could no longer attend my trip because of a death. I kept being told I could not cancel my room because the hotel said it was against their policy and I would be charged the full $400. I said F Hotels.com, I am calling the hotel who was very kind and let me cancel my reservation. The hotel also said they had spoke with Hotels.com reps and that the reps just had told them I wanted to cancel. Nothing about the fact I had a family death and was no longer able to attend my reservation.</p>
<p>First of all I made a booking for Mercure Amsterdam City hotel in July 2017 and canceled August 2017 in plenty of time not to be charged. Then after my trip to Amsterdam I was charged by Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk hotel (a different hotel) for not turning up?!? Confused? I was too! So my trip to Amsterdam was for 6th-8th October 2017. On the 18th of October this hotel charged me £217.72 &amp; £5.98 for a no-show. A no-show!?! So a booking I hadn't even made they still took money out of my account. I chased it for two days back and forth between Mercure Sloterdijk &amp; Hotels.com to be told by Hotels.com their computer system doesn't lie &amp; that I did make the booking and I cannot get my money back! </p>
<p>I booked a stay at a hotel in Jamaica Montego Bay using Hotels.com. Before booking, it stated that I have free cancellation. When I received my reservation confirmation from Hotels.com, my dates were changed and the cancellation policy did not have a free cancellation on it. I called Hotels.com immediately. The customer service rep told me that he could not correct the dates on his end because he was having computer problems. Instead, he told me to go to Hotels.com website and correct the dates and he would call the hotel on Monday about the mistake since the hotel business's center wasn't opened on the weekends. I called the hotel on the following Monday to confirm. The hotel told me that I have two reservation with them.</p>
<p>Arriving in Kuala Lumpur for the Grand Prix weekend with flights hotel and event ticks all purchased in advance. Received an email the day before we arrived saying our hotel was overbooked so Hotel.com would upgrade us to a better hotel and gave us its name. I checked it out and it was a lower standard cheaper hotel in a poorer area so I replied it was not an upgrade and not suitable. I had prepaid for my hotel and it was confirmed.</p>
<p>Trying to cancel a reservation for 2 days and I was told the systems were down. Then all of the sudden the systems is back up and they can't find any record of me calling to cancel this reservation and I run out of time to do it. DON'T USE THEM!!!</p>
<p>Wait time of 2 minutes is actually 20 minutes only to reach a moron. Forget the membership awards program. They negate the nights in a short period of time. The nights they are supposed to credit, stayed in pending status until I called and had to wait forever to speak to a rep who manually credited them. The outfit deserves the one star other people are giving it. And I'm sure it's losing customers to other discount sites. Try Hotels Tonight app. Much much better.</p>
<p>My husband booked a stay at a Travelodge and used this site to book. He was quoted $100 before taxes for the room. He booked the room and stayed. While at the check out counter he signed the receipt from Travelodge for $111.00. Later, we received our credit card statement showing a charge for $123 from Hotels.com plus a convenience fee of $14.99 that we were never told about or agreed to. I called to Hotels.com to dispute this amount and the woman I spoke to had such a thick accent I could barely understand her. I told her the receipt my husband signed for the hotel was for $111.00, and that they charged us a fee we knew nothing about. I told her I wanted the amount charged corrected to original amount minus their ridiculous fee. She said she couldn't even look up my reservation because neither my husband's name nor mine showed in their system, so she couldn't correct it. </p>
<p>This company missells the services of the hotels they offer by not declaring up front the full extent of the charges a consumer will incur when staying at the hotels they offer. When you call Hotels.com (usually after checking in - which is way too late), and complaining about the charges you then have to incur, Hotels.com, direct you to pages 5/6 way down in the small print, that the hotel have declared their parking charges. Why Hotels.com feel parking charges are irrelevant to a person's booking and don't feel they need to be part of a comparison exercise, is completely due to poor management. When you complain, they say they have declared them under hotel info, it's way down the bottom, showing they think it is not important.</p>
<p>I booked two rooms on our way from Florida in Charlotte, NC for same night and got directions, how to get there from Hotels.com app. When we arrived to the hotel Country Inn, receptionist said, that they don't have our reservation, I called to Hotels.com and asked to help me. I been told, that my reservation is for Country Inn, but in another city, as I asked to move my reservation to hotel in Charlotte, NC. Agent told me, that he can't do that, so the best way is to cancel reservation and pay for stay directly to hotel and in one hour I should receive letter with instructions, how to get refund from Hotels.com. After few days and maybe five phone calls I got e-mail, that they not plan to refund my money ($215). I asked to speak to somebody from the management but until now without success.</p>
<p>We purchased a number of rooms from Hotels.com. When we went to use our points (we had over 2 free stays available) they had deleted all of the points. We called them and they would not reissue the points. Bad company. Bad customer service.</p>
<p>I booked a motel/hotel online through Hotels.com and was send a guarantee email that my room was available but when I went to check in the desk clerk attempted to charge me a extra one hundred dollars over and above the amount that had already been stolen from my debit card account (Direct Express). When many times I attempted to get my money put back into my debit card account all I was given was the runaround. With absolutely no answers why I was refused the room when already I had the reservation and a guarantee that I would receive it for the amount that was stolen by Hotels.com from my debit card.</p>
<p>Made an error by booking wrongs dates. I turned up to the Novotel hotel in Melbourne to check in when they told me it was actually the day I was checking out. They said not a problem because they had rooms and were more than happy to let me stay at the same rates I booked with hotels.com (3rd party). When I called and explain all this the customer service man said he called Novotel and all this would be fine except then his Supervisor overrode this and wouldn't allow it with no refund at all. Complete greed and ruthlessness from a company that clearly doesn't care about their loyal customers. Which they have lost me forever. Extremely disappointed and when Novotel was so nice and willing to just change the dates and no cost. It was grand final weekend and everything already cost a lot that weekend. Very very bitter about this.</p>
<p>I am the live-in caretaker for my mother who is frail and suffers from dementia. My sister is the only person who provides respite care. My husband and I booked a two night stay with Hotel.com. We were forced to try to move the reservation at the Philadelphia Doubletree-Center City because my sister has been unable to get off of Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria hit. Four flights have been secured and cancelled by airlines. We explained this. To add to the stress, both the hotel and the Hotel.com have pointed fingers at one another claiming the other refuses to change the reservation. Never use Hotel.com. Two nights gone and the room empty. We will have to wait until we can afford another break in four months.</p>
<p>I have used several websites to book hotel reservations and this one is the absolute worst. On September 11 I reserved two rooms on Hotels.com at a hotel in Saratoga Springs New York for the evening of Saturday 9/16 so my family could go visit other family members. My receipt's cancellation policy stated that if I change my booking after August 6, 2017 I will be charged a 100% fee. I assumed it was a mistake, since, as I said, the date I booked it was September 11. A few days later we received a call that due to an emergency the planned trip had to be canceled. </p>
<p>I booked a total of 8 nights via the company website thinking that I would get credit(s) for night stayed but when I inquired getting stay credit the company stated I was not eligible for credits on dates stay even though they were less than a week old. The CS rep said "basically said it was my fault for not enrolling in their rewards program properly". I feel my request such as this is reasonable because it is based upon accurate data and booked via their websites which is not all that clear. I feel that even though Hotels.com acknowledge stay credit but tossed up a set of hidden policies rather than issue a stay credit.</p>
<p>I just had the most disturbing call with Hotels.com. I have been a loyal client and had accumulated "nights". I was, in a very dismissive manner, told by Shanan they have "expired" without notice. I will never use this service again based on the lack of customer service. There are many other sites to obtain competitive rates.</p>
<p>I Booked a Hotel in New York for 5 days this Oct 2017 and at the time I was informed if at anytime up till the time we go we should find the hotel at a cheaper rate they would match it. That is not the case. The next day Booking.com sends me a text informing me that they have a cheaper rate. I phone Hotels.com and they will not match the price because the room was already sold so they would not honor their agreement. Even if the room is there as I told him I could not book the room as I had booked our rooms non refundable. Will never do that again either. I will not use these people ever again and I will tell people not to use their website or services.</p>
<p>I had a reservation for a hotel room I made several weeks ago with Hotels.com. I didn't notice that it had a one week cancellation policy since everything else I have ever reserved had a one day cancellation policy. A few may have been 2 days but never a week. These are for reservations I was making in Spain and Portugal. In any event, I called on the last possible day, but I was about 6 hours late because of the time change. The agent tried to contact the hotel directly and couldn't so she sent them an email. </p>
<p>NEVER BOOK WITH HOTELS.COM. We made a reservation of 2 rooms in Munich via Hotels.com on 12th of August. Hotel name is Marc Munchen. We stayed there before and it is very nice. These rooms were with free cancellation till 23rd of August. Next day we changed our plan and decided to cancel our booking. After the cancellation we received an email notification that cancellation is successful and money will be refunded in 1 week. It has been already a month since we made the cancellation but we did not receive any money. I had many conversations with customer support managers of different level, but every time they say that they made a refund and I need to check out with my bank. Bank says that they did not receive any money from hotels.com. I also sent multiple emails with printout of all transactions from my account, but there is no result.</p>
<p>Hotels.com website has changed... &amp; not for the better. :( They now charge much higher prices - so it costs more than competitive sites &amp; even booking directly with the hotel costs less! In addition, they have now added 'fees' i.e. a commission charged to you... whilst they are simultaneously charging the hotel a commission for your booking with Hotels.com. This is unethical &amp; is called 'double dipping'! So, guess what? That "Free" 11th night... They actually make you pay for that night through their 'fees'. Do the math &amp; your homework, folks! If it is not cheaper for the total booking, do not use them. Sometimes they run flash sales or deep discounts, but these promos usually run 24 hrs and you have to move fast. Also... Poor customer service... A bunch of young girls in the Philippines who are basically just reading from a script...</p>
<p>Unlike the rest of the world that shows professional standards during hurricanes and other natural disasters, Hotels.com would not waive the cancellation fee for a one night stay in Cancun. The agent (Alexander) that I spoke with to alert the company I had no way of getting to the hotel because of flight cancellations was only interested in declaring that the cancellation fee was the amount of the reservation. I called the hotel and was assured they would not charge me or the reservation system, but the charge showed up anyway from Hotels.com. The airlines made requested changes without fees and rebooked me three times due to cancellations. Hotels.com took advantage of the situation and should be penalized by the State of Florida and Georgia for unlawful acts during a natural disaster. I plan to make sure that the proper authorities are made aware of Hotels.com un-American policies.</p>
<p>CASE of CHEATING by misinformation of address on Hotels.com website &amp; Hotels.com not taking any responsibility for data on their website. Hotels.com shows the location of this hotel in 'Goregaon Area'. The actual location of the hotel is 50-60 mins away forcing a 2 hr commute. Completely wrong information about the address of the hotel by Hotels.com would obviously be a serious reason to cancel the reservation &amp; refund the entire amount. But like a Cheat, Hotels.com's telecaller Mr. ** asked us to talk to the hotel for wrong address &amp; refused to return the money.</p>
<p>Margaritaville Resort Biloxi - Day 1. Got to hotel room to find soiled pants in the bathroom that were not mine or my family members. Complained to the hotel manager and moved us to another room. This next room found the comforter on the bed to look like there was some soil like stain on it. Complained the hotel and moved us to another room. Day 2. Parked via valet. Leaving to go to dinner with my family only to find that my vehicle was broken into with no signs of forced entry. To the hotel's credit, they comped my stay. Police report was filed but no reimbursement for the expensive item stolen from my vehicle (which was locked in the vehicle with no sign of forced entry). Cameras up but not working.</p>
<p>Words can not express how crappy this company is. I will never use them again - and I am going to tell everyone I know. I had a hotel booked in Charleston, SC for a conference. It had been booked for weeks. Hurricane Irma is going to hit Charleston the day we are supposed to check in. The governor of SC declared SC to be in a state-of-emergency, and Hotels.com held on to our money. They would not refund it. Screw you Hotels.com, you are a bunch of money-hungry scum bags. How can you sleep at night.</p>
<p>I called Hotels.com to book a hotel with a jetted bathtub. He assured me that I would have one. I paid for it as well. When I got to the hotel, they told me that they don't have any record of that. So I ended up paying an extra 100 the clerk charge me for an upgrade. I got home two weeks later and was charged 200 instead of 100 from resort casino. So both parties took advantages of me. Hotels.com is misleading. He made me cancel my first booking which was cheaper to have me pay more for a jetted tub that I requested and never got. I spent $597 bucks for two days. When I was only suppose to pay $397. I'm very upset and will not use either party ever again. Money does not fall off of trees.</p>
<p>HORRIBLE customer service!!! I just returned from a motorcycle road trip, we stay in different hotels every night as we only explored an area for the day and then moved. We do not make any reservations ahead of time because we never know where we will be. So we used the Hotel.com app (as we've done for over 5 years) when we get to a town we will be staying in. I was on a mission this trip to use only Hotels.com so that we could 'earn' our free night for an out of town wedding we had coming up. So I booked all our nights through Hotels.com, even when we were told from four of hotels that we could save between $20 and $42 if we booked directly through the hotel itself. I opted to pay more through Hotels.com so that I could get that free night!! On the last night of our trip, which was our tenth hotel stay, I noted a huge banner at the bottom on the app as I was booking "5% OFF on our app - Use Code MOB5" so I did and saved a whopping $5.02!!!</p>
<p>August 28, 2017 I cancelled hotel reservation for August 31, 2017 reservation. On August 30 my debit card was charged $96.34. I alerted Hotels.com and I was hung up on, lied to about I needed to talk to the hotel. Then out of my persistence they sent an email saying they were trying to get in touch with the manager to refund my money. I haven't received any more emails yet. I'm dissatisfied and disappointed that it's that easy to take people's hard earn cash. Who censors online business? Who else can I contact?</p>
<p>Twice in a row now, Hotels.com has ripped us off. How they are allowed to get away with being this dishonest and incompetent renders me speechless. On one occasion, we were traveling and booked a hotel in a small resort town, and got a confirmation email. We arrived late, and were told that there "was a problem" and that Hotels.com had screwed up... That they were full. Apparently, Hotels.com's database was wrong about room availability, and they left us completely stranded... No rooms for 200 miles. They not only never apologized, they refused to refund our money.</p>
<p>I joined Hotels.com and earned 9 nights towards a free night. Unfortunately my young sister died unexpectedly after an accident and everything changed. My hotel nights were forgotten about because I had to travel overseas multiple times in the year to help sort things out. They expired, I hadn’t received any notices to tell me, I noticed after 5 weeks of expiration. Hotels.com were completely unsympathetic. I spoke to a supervisor Sam, who said she was in Central America, tried to escalate my problem but she said she was at the top of the chain so it was useless to try getting anyone else. I have never cancelled or caused any trouble with bookings with the company so I think they were extremely heartless in this regard. I wouldn't have cared less if it was just 1 or 2 but to be 1 away from my 10 nights was harsh.</p>
<p>I was using Hotels.com for a multiple day trip through out BC and they had a promotion where if I book 10 hotels using my account I receive one night free. I booked all the Hotels for the trip and used my account which I had setup with Hotels.com so I can begin to "save up nights" and redeem the free hotel booking at a later date once I reached the required number. For one of the nights I sent the confirmation email to my wife so she can have the information for the trip and where we will be staying. Well I came back from the trip and have realized that they did not count that night because I had sent the confirmation booking from Hotels.com to my wife's email account and it did not match the email address that was on the Hotels.com account which was my own. I called their customer service department to explain the situation and they were not willing to help or do anything in an act of good will. </p>
<p>Horrible customer service. How can a company like this stay in business? We made a huge mistake by reserving a hotel through Hotels.com. The hotels we picked didn't offer any accessibility options and refused to give us a room on the first floor. Obviously we had to find a different hotel that day. Hotels.com refused to issue a refund. Their excuse was very simple: your reservation is not refundable. These criminals should be banned from doing business.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I work in the hospitality industry, I was having no luck with finding a hotel in my price range in the central London area for some dates in May of 2018. I have used hotels.com before and it has always worked out for me. I found a property that had very favorable reviews and booked it. A few days later we found out that our travel plans had to change so I reached out to the hotels.com representative to cancel it. The representative advised me the rate was nonrefundable. As I mentioned previously, I work in the industry, I am well aware when exceptions can be made. If I was canceling on the day of arrival or even the day before, I would not expect a refund; this was nine months away. I asked the representative to call the property directly to see if they could waive the penalty. The representative claimed she called them and reported back to me the answer was still no, they could not refund the rate. </p>
<p>Hotels.com failed to notify the DoubleTree Hotel in Anaheim, Calif. that I canceled my reservation and so the hotel charged me $285.94 as a no-show. And here is the weird part... I had confirmation in an email of the cancellation but when I had Hotels.com on the phone, suddenly all my correspondence and this cancellation document magically disappeared in my email account. It was this cancellation document and all other correspondence with them. I know that sounds impossible but that's exactly what happened. The 5th telephone person in customer service said he would submit this situation to be reviewed. This is what I learned: Never use a third party, like Hotels.com, to make your reservations. Just call the hotel yourself.</p>
<p>It's such a disappointment that companies that provide a service take advantage and rip-off their clients. I made a reservation with HOTELS.COM through the application on my phone, paid for down payment that I could "CANCEL FOR FREE" within a period of time before my actual reservation. I found a Better Deal for the same place and time on EXPEDIA so I cancel my reservation with HOTELS.COM, waited for those 15-20 days after cancellation to have my money return. </p>
<p>My family and I were on a trip to the Nashville area for the solar eclipse. We made reservations through Hotels.com for a hotel in Gordonsville TN. We made it just outside of Nashville and called the hotel and found out they were already booked. Hotels.com booked our rooms for September when we had tonight (8-20-17) selected as the date we needed. Hotels.com refused to reimburse our cost and the hotel refused also saying they had a no refund policy. This wasn't our fault seeing how Hotels.com made an error while booking the room.</p>
<p>I have never dealt with a more incompetent company in my life. I had a horrible experience at a hotel in Mexico who charged me for a room I never saw and would not allow me access to the amenities I paid for. I called Hotels.com and spoke with a manager named Lucy would promised to make it right with me and was going to call the hotel and contact me back within 24 hours. This did not happen and when I called back, there was no record of my call. No one was working on anything. There is also no record of when I updated my reservation from the terrible hotel to a better one. Every single time I call there, I can different info (inaccurate) and there is never a record of my call. They are doing nothing to help me. Worse, they are making information up. Nothing they say is accurate. NOTHING. It is unreal how they have treated me. Will NEVER use them again. Stay away.</p>
<p>I was traveling through Spokane Washington on a rainy night so I decided to get a room at the Red Lion Hotel. The lady looked me up and down as I approached the door and said, "We don't have any room. We're booked". Then I notified her that I've already booked the room on Hotels.com. She said, "Well we're already at full capacity." I said, "But my room is already booked," she said, "Let me see your reservation" then proceeded to look at the computer like there was something wrong then she told me, "Yeah we don't accept those credit cards." It was a debit card from Wells Fargo. I was totally through at that point then she proceeded to tell me that I can call Hotels.com and let them know that she canceled my reservation so I did so and never received my $86.42 back... </p>
<p>I went online to book a room so I googled Cavendish PEI to rent a hotel room in PEI and I clicked on a link from Hotels.com and re-entered the location of hotel desired and a list of hotel popped out... so I looked at most hotel and booked a nice hotel and paid with PayPal. When email confirmation arrived, I was like what is this. Then I googled the address of the email confirmation of hotel and google to me it was in UK, not even 3 minutes after I realized it is bad, I went online to cancel it and it told me that nothing was reimbursable... I was like "what the hell". Not my fault Hotels.com brought me there!!! So I called them right away explaining them the story I just told you and they said they would try to call the manager and ask them to reimburse.</p>
<p>Be aware of room details with Hotels.com. We were on the road looking at the Hotels.com website. We needed 2 double beds and a sofa bed. We could find this information on the website and called to confirm we were actually getting a sofa bed. Customer service would always say "Yes. That is what the description reads." We would show up at the hotel and right away they would say "I bet you are looking for a sofa bed because you booked through Hotels.com." We would say "yes" and they would say "It is a chair. Not a sofa bed." We have had several problems with their descriptions and we tried to get Hotels.com to change it but they refuse. We called Hotels.com to change our room and the highest level they could give me was a Customer Service Supervisor and he could do NOTHING! This is after we have been on the road for 10 hours and 9pm at night.</p>
<p>I booked 2 hotel rooms at Wyndham Garden Sterling Heights through Hotels.com for my son's 5th Birthday party. When I received my confirmation receipt, I read through it and noticed that the Water Park at the hotel was only opened on Fridays and Saturdays, my son's birthday party was scheduled for Sunday. The water park was the whole reason I reserved the hotel in the place, Hotels.com failed to mention the park would not be opened on their website prior to me reserving the rooms. I had to cancel my son's party and not only that we can't have another party until a week after his birthday because I will not have access to the refund for 5-7 days. The supervisor did give me a $100 voucher, but that is no match for the inconvenience or the upset that this has caused my child.</p>
<p>I booked a room on Hotels.com in July 2017 for a trip in late August to move my daughter into Texas Tech. I received the confirmation that it was paid, but after driving 8 hrs, I showed up at the Hotel and they said they did not have my name in the system. Hotels.com did not send it. They kept putting me on hold, because they had to talk to the Hotel, then it would have taken forever for them to find another. Luckily, the front desk of Wingate Wyndham in Lubbock called a new hotel to see if they had a room, and they had just had a cancellation. Do not use Hotels.com. Horrible company, and based on reviews, this happens a lot. The front desk of the hotel said it always happens.</p>
<p>Hotels.com has done an absolutely horrible job of owning their responsibilities and taking care of the customer as they promised they do. I booked every single hotel (across 5 different cities) for a trip to Ireland through Hotels.com thinking that anything that I would need would be addressed in a timely manner and the proper care given. This was sadly not the case.</p>
<p>I booked the Mansion Inn in St. Pete through Hotels.com and it was totally unacceptable... Not at all what was described. It was more expensive than the Marriott, Holiday Inn and other luxury hotels - was supposed to be a Bed n Breakfast, but there was no breakfast, the bed was broken, there were no parking spots, no hot water in for the shower, no English speaking representative at 'front desk', no wifi... The place was very rundown and in need of a safety health inspection. When I contacted Hotels.com to inform them, they offered me a $50 coupon, but nothing about verifying the accuracy of the property or getting a refund from the sham BnB. Since the coupon could only be used if I booked with them in the future, I declined it.</p>
<p>Recently I booked a hotel through hotels.com. The prices I was quoted on their website were in Canadian dollars. When I checked out of the hotel, they charged me the dollar amount from my quote, but in USD. The quotation I received from Hotels.com was clearly indicating CAD on the page. The option to pay now or later showed the same amount (in CAD). Every time I received a response from hotels.com it started with "Thank you for your response" and then they would go on to ignore every screen shot I sent them showing the CAD in the quotation. When I requested to speak with someone, they ignored my request, and I posed 2 specific questions in order to try and resolve the issue, again they ignored my questions. This company is a RIP OFF and provides consumers with false and misleading prices and then takes no responsibility for it.</p>
<p>I book a hotel night on July 30th 2017 in Oregon and when I get to the hotel that I booked and paid for at 11 pm the hotel said they never received my booking from Hotels.com and there is no room left in that hotel that night, so I had to call Hotels.com to find another place to sleep before I do a 7 hours drive back to Vancouver. On next morning I was on the phone with them for OVER 2 HOURS!! They keep putting me on hold!! Finally they found me a hotel to stay but I HAVE TO PAID FOR IT ON MY CARD FIRST! Because somehow they can't pay for it from the website but the supervisor was telling me that I'll get the full amount of CA$304 reimburse to my credit card (I confirm with her a few times because I was really uncomfortable about paying another hotel on top of CA$189 that I already paid for the hotel that I never get to stayed.) plus a US$75 voucher toward my next trip because they feel sorry about what happened.</p>
<p>I had booked 8 rooms for a special event and when we got home I had noticed that I was billed twice, once from hotels.com and once from the hotel. The hotel did credit two of the rooms back right away but not all 8 for some reason. I have contacted hotels.com several times to keep hearing the same thing. "Give us 48-72 hours to check into this." Nothing yet, it's not like it's a couple hundred dollars. it's 2000 dollars. What the heck???</p>
<p>Just never use Hotels.com. I have booked this app for half price in Shoreditch. It was still expensive, they just wanted to attract people. When I came there, the place was very dirty, noisy and no air. I cleaned up my room first and they agreed I could change the room the next day in the evening. When I came back the next day, they put my stuff in the suitcase, my glasses and delicate things without protection. Jewellery, everything upside down and one of my trousers was wet and dirty. I was so shocked! They didn't even apologized. They put the blame on me, I should have emptied the room in the morning... I stayed for one more night in the new room and the air was even worse and noisy as well. I woke up in the middle of the night. I left immediately in the morning and of course they say no money back!!! I'm in a proper hotel now! Still waiting for the answer of the manager.</p>
<p>I really wish I would have read reviews before booking hotels through this site. Cancellation fee is bogus. If I booked directly through the Alakai hotel in Wisconsin Dells the cancellation fee is only $20 but through Hotels.com it was $82.09. WHAT? Now that I've read reviews DON'T BOOK THROUGH WEBSITE. Use the website to get an idea of what hotels are in the area you want to visit and call hotel directly. The prices you get by going to hotel directly are the same, if not better.</p>
<p>When we booked our room for the Drury Inn Horn Lake, MS the employees accessed our credit card and immediately took it to the Kroger store across the street from Drury Inn and tried to shop with it. We were notified by our bank's fraud unit at once. We arrived at the Drury Inn and they refused our reservations with cash payment and insisted we had to have a credit card (which had been canceled thanks to them) so we had nowhere to stay. The assistant manager was rude and unprofessional and the other staff found our situation to be funny and were laughing.</p>
<p>Terrible customer service. I've booked 20 nights on Hotels.com platform hoping to collect nights through their Rewards program (you get a free night once you book 10 nights) but unfortunately they claimed that my accounts is not enrolled to collect nights. Weird, I've been a loyal client for over 7 years now and never had issues with the Rewards program but at the end of the day they probably believe that they don't need to look after their customers anymore.</p>
<p>I booked a bus tour of London on Hotels.com for $180.00 (two people) and immediately realized that I had put in the wrong date. Within minutes of making the reservation I called Hotels.com and asked them if I could change the date. They said it was impossible to change the date, I would have to cancel the reservation and book another one. My money would be returned within a week, they said. So I booked the tour on the correct date (with a different company) and when I got home from my trip I noticed that my money had not been returned from Hotels.com. </p>
<p>Hotels.com does not honor its price guarantee promise. When I found a lower rate through the hotel itself, the customer service rep (Erleen **) said that my link was for a different hotel. They never even followed the link or would have realized that the hotel is part of a 3-hotel group. What a scam!</p>
<p>We booked 10 nights with Hotels.com to get 11th free bonus night. Once we booked 10th night, our previous history got deleted and when we spoke to customer care they didn't give us 11th bonus night. This is all scam. Please be aware of this scam bonus night provided by Hotels.Com. You can get much cheaper deals at Priceline and Cheap Tickets, Orbitz and Expedia are the best. Hotels.Com has poor customer service.</p>
<p>This Hotels.com site is really tricky! They rush you to book faster and make mistakes. I try to book for August 5 but never saw the check in &amp; out (the e-mail after shows my booking on the same night July 20) and because you hurry to make sure you will get a room, you can easily make mistake and even if you call right away to cancel, you will never get your money back because the company (Hotels.com) and the hotel (Best western Inn) will blame the other by throwing you like a tennis ball from one to another until you give up trying. Take a good advice, book directly from the Hotel and proceed by phone. I just can't believe they can get away like that and take the money from people.</p>
<p>Customer service is horrible. I booked hotel and I checked price very next day. I noticed price difference with same hotel so I called them for lowest price guarantee. As per them I have to cancel my reservation then book new one. I do not want to lose my existing reservation if something happen. I AM REQUESTING YOU DO NOT TRAP ON PRICE MATCH GIMMICKS. Why not they match price right and right there. Talking about price difference is right on their site not any other site. HOTWIRE is better and has better price than hotels.com.</p>
<p>This booking service is highly unprofessional. We booked a three and a half week honeymoon road trip across the USA through them and have had nothing but trouble. After just the first week, we had lost two bookings for no reason and had a third hotel we had to wait well over an hour and a half just to check into because of all the issues we had been having with the previous hotels. Yes, they were easy to use at first, but after just a couple of visits, all hell broke loose. Very disappointed. Hey Captain Obvious, it's obvious you don't know what you are doing and should get out of the hotel business and get back to sea where you belong, where you can't hurt anyone else.</p>
<p>Made reservation through Hotels.com for eclipse event 8/21/2017. Called hotel to confirm reservation. Was told some customers had had reservations canceled due to water main break, but if I hadn't received a call I was fine. I had not received a call but wanted to check that the hotel had my correct contact information. They did not. Hotels.com DID have my contact information but did not pass this along to the hotel. So when my reservation was canceled, the hotel had no way to reach me. And by the time I found out, it was too late to make another reservation. Every hotel in the area was booked solid. I will never use Hotels.com again, because they do not provide guest contact info to the hotel.</p>
<p>I booked a room in Fresno at a hotel that was advertised on Hotels.com website. I later found out that this hotel has had problems in the past so I booked another room at a different hotel in the area then went back to Hotels.com and canceled the first hotel. Come to find out that they will not refund me my money and will not reissue my confirmation on the room. I called the hotel and they informed me that the Hotel has no problem with reissuing the room but Hotels.com has to be the one to push it through which they denied trying. The long story short is I am out $ 150.00 and cant even get the room back and give it to a homeless person for the night. Hotels.com is not a customer service company and I will never use them again.</p>
<p>I booked a room at the Copthorne Hotel at Auckland and was paid for online. I checked my bank account a few days later and noted a separate charge of $25 for travel service fee. I was curious as to where this charge come from so I tried to contact the number for Hotels.com to confirm whether they charge my account for booking. After a couple of failed attempts, my wife called the hotel and they informed us that there is no other fees apart from the hotel fees. They also gave us another contact number for Hotels.com and my wife finally got through and they confirmed that there is no booking or travel service fees. I visited the bank yesterday and they confirmed that the payment of the hotel room and travel serve fees were charged to the same account, two separate payments to the same account number. WOW!</p>
<p>On June 18, my husband and I decided to look for a hotel in the LA area. When we searched Google it showed a rate for a really nice hotel. We selected the date we wanted (which was that night) and paid. 10 seconds later we get an email stating the date as more than 3 weeks out!! We immediately called and were told "The hotel said no refunds and it's their decision". We then called the hotel and the hotel said they did not say that and as long as we paid the stay that night they would cancel with no penalty.</p>
<p>DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE! I made the bad mistake of booking a hotel room in NYC with them. I chose the Hilton downtown for 5 nights. Two days after I made my reservation, my dates had changed. Now, I needed six nights. I went on their website, booked an extra night for an exorbitant fee. The day before I was supposed to check in, I decided to call the Hilton to make sure that everything was okay with my reservation. It wasn't. The Hilton wasn't notified of the change, and they were sold out for that night. I called Hotels.com. Their phone system is bad. It keeps hanging up on you. Small inconvenience to put up with for a hotel room.</p>
<p>My wife was trying to add an extra night in South Dakota. She found a nice rate from Saturday to Sunday. She booked a room for that night. When she checked the email confirmation it had it for that Friday to Saturday. I had to call their "Customer Service" since I work in that field. They stated they couldn't get me that rate but could get one for just 10 dollars more. My wife was fine with that since she was unsure if the mistake was hers. After I got off the phone with them, I noticed her website showing the dates were actually Saturday - Sunday. When we got to the hotel I asked them about the refund. They stated Hotels.com told them we wanted 2 rooms that night. I had to show them the email that stated it was actually one. The hotel refunded us for the extra room. When I got home I decided to call their "Customer Service" about their unethical behavior.</p>
<p>I had a reservation that I made through Hotels.com for two rooms at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. There was a written cancellation policy included in the email confirmation that I received from them, which stated if you cancelled by a certain date (72 hours prior) you would not be charged. I called both Hotels.com and Hard Rock Hotel prior to the penalty period to cancel my reservation. The hotel said I needed to cancel through Hotels.com. I spoke with a representative from Hotels.com and they said they had spoken with the hotel and they assured me that I would not be charged for the reservation. The day I was supposed to check in I received an email stating I would be charged for one night for each room. When I called the hotel, they said they never received the necessary paperwork from Hotels.com so they were unable to cancel the reservation. They had record that they had spoken with them and had requested said paperwork.</p>
<p>DO NOT USE HOTELS.COM. I booked four rooms in the incorrect hotel. My fault. I caught in less than a week. I called to rebook in correct hotel. They rebooked me and when I arrived at the correct hotel they only had 1 room booked there. They still had 3 rooms booked in the wrong hotel. I spent two hours on the phone trying to get this straightened out with them to no avail. They have the worst customer service that I have ever dealt with.</p>
<p>I booked a room with HOTELS.COM. Was sent a mail that the room was guaranteed and booked for me to check in. Upon arrival at the hotel was refused a stay as the pic on site did not match the hotel. Came to India and contacted Hotels.com and they could not find out as to why I did not get a room. Hotels.com were to call and let me know but even to date they haven't got a clue as they don't speak the language the hoteliers speak. Finally was told I will get the refund, and Rs500 compensation which will be sent to my bank within 7 days.</p>
<p>This company hides the cancellation terms and policies until you receive the email confirmation. You are also promised free nights for booking through them. Those free nights never materialize. I had 8 nights taken from my account even though booking appears on my profile. Weeks to deal with and still nothing. Avoid!</p>
<p>Hotels advertises that they will match lower price if you inform them 48 hours or more prior to the reservation. I called inquiring about this because their own website showed a lower price; what I got instead was an agent who told me that I would have to cancel and rebook my reservation. When I contacted customer service via email (and send in this request), hotels said it was too late. These stupid and pathetic service people have yet to understand that their own service people provided me the wrong information. 10 emails and counting, and now saying they want to record my experience so it does not happen again.</p>
<p>In January I booked a hotel via Hotels.com for my trip in June. The reason for the early booking was due to 2 (two) events (America's Cup &amp; Carnival) happening on the Island (Bermuda). When reaching the island the hotel was no longer in operation. The owners of the hotel were also the owners of a restaurant that was next to the hotel. The owners of the hotel told me that they had contacted Hotels.com in February to let them know that they were no longer in operation. This is the first mishap on Hotels.com part. They did not relay this information to myself and several other people who ended up at the hotel trying to check in. With no help from Hotels.com, we had to search for a new hotel to stay at. This took the whole day as the island was booked to capacity due to the two events going on. </p>
<p>I booked a room at Radisson hotel - 4444 Gateway Blvd at Edmonton through Hotels.com and later cancelled it. The gentleman at the hotel very clearly said that the reservation has been cancelled and since it was a no show I will not be charged. I called up again couple of days again for check my refund, I was told clearly that I will not be charged or if at all I will be charged only for a day. I have call records to prove that I cancelled the reservation. But now Radisson hotel says that I did not call as their staff did not write any log in my records.</p>
<p>My girlfriend did me a favor and booked a 6-night stay for me on her credit card. Then I booked an additional 2 nights on my own card and I stayed in 3 other hotels within 2 weeks. Now that I've earned 1 free night with Hotels.com, they're telling me I don't get the 6-night credit on my account because my girlfriend paid even though it was in my name, and the other 2 nights I don't get credit for because I just started the account. Just a crock of soup **, biggest scam. Do not use this company. They are the worst lying cheating scum buckets!</p>
<p>I was planning a trip for myself and my grandsons. This was their first time to the ocean so making this super special was very important to me. I went on Hotels.com to find the best deal I could. I surf through for a while but nothing seem to fit my budget, until I came across the Super 8. I was hesitant at first but when I seen the pictures I was like WOW I am sold. So we got everything booked and ready to go. When we arrived we’re completely blown away. The pictures and the hotel were NOTHING alike. I was so disappointed. I even asked for my money back and they told me there was a 72 hour window to cancel the hotel booking. Well of course we wasn't there at the time. So we was denied the request of a refund. </p>
<p>Booked a reservation through Hotel.com, was told by Hotel.com that I had the best rate only to find out when I got to the hotel that a 20% further discount for either AAA or Senior Discount could have been offered had I booked with the hotel directly. OUTRAGEOUS! I called Hotel.com, reached a Supervisor in El Salvador named Alexander (He refused to give me any other ID info) who was rude and cared nothing about my loss. NEVER USE HOTEL.COM AGAIN!</p>
<p>Hotels.com notified me 2 months ago that someone had hacked into my account. They gave me a phone number to call. That phone number was an endless automated answering service with no way to reach a human. I finally got to a human who could not resolve the problem and said they'd get back in 72 hours. It's now been 2 months with no reply. </p>
<p>I booked a hotel through Hotels.com in Marquette, MI for August (more than a month from now). In red print I was advised that I could book now and pay later. To me, this means that I would pay at the hotel. To Hotels.com, this meant two days later. The entire cost of the booking was taken from my bank account and "customer service" at Hotels.com told me the only way to recoup my money was to cancel and pay a fee. Their claim that this information was disclosed to me is inaccurate. Prepayment is MUCH different than what I understood from the information on the website. I will definitely refrain from using this website again-- no money saved and a huge problem caused. In addition, I was offered no help from the person I reached aside from the offer to pay a cancellation penalty. My business is clearly not worth their time and energy.</p>
